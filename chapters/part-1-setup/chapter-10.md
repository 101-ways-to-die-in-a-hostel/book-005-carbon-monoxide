# Chapter 10: The Air You Carry

Her phone goes black in her hand, and the screen holds her face for a second, warped in rain and light, before it dies.

She stops under a dripping awning and presses the power button. Nothing. The message that said See you tonight is already gone, swallowed by the dark. Hannah keeps walking and doesn't notice until Mara jogs to catch up, the phone a dead brick in her fist.

"Battery?" Hannah asks, glancing back over her shoulder.

"Maybe," Mara says. She thinks of the message, of the hostel sign flickering behind them like a bad goodbye. She decides not to say it. She is trying to leave things behind. That should include words.

The new hostel is three streets away, tucked between a bakery and a pharmacy. It smells like bread and disinfectant, which is somehow better than metal and damp wool. The lobby is bright, all white paint and a mural of mountains. There is a big window open to the street. The air moves on purpose here.

The receptionist is a young woman with a nose ring and a steady gaze. She smiles like she is practiced at smiling without promising anything. "Passport?" she asks, and holds out her hand.

Mara's stomach tightens. She sets her bag down and digs through it, fingers fast and clumsy. Charger, hairbrush, oxygen can, camera battery. No passport. She checks the outer pocket where she keeps it when she is nervous. Empty. She checks the inner pocket anyway. Still empty.

"I have a scan," she says, because she needs to say something. She looks at her phone, dead. She looks at her laptop, zipped in its sleeve. "On my laptop. If I open it."

The receptionist shrugs, a small, sympathetic movement. "We can do a copy for one night," she says. "But you need the original by tomorrow." She taps a clipboard. "Rules."

Rules are a language Mara has learned to speak. She unzips the laptop and opens it, the screen coming alive with a soft glow. She finds the scan in an email from herself, the one she sent when her mother insisted on it before her first solo trip. The receptionist glances at it and nods.

"One night," she says. "Please bring it in the morning."

Mara nods, relief and dread mixing in her throat. Hannah squeezes her shoulder, a quick, quiet confirmation that this is manageable. Mara signs the sheet with a hand that still feels shaky from rain.

The lobby has a posted list of house rules in neat English and Spanish. No smoking. Quiet hours after 10. No outside guests. A small line at the bottom says, in smaller font, "No gas heaters in rooms." The sentence is so simple it feels like a miracle. Mara reads it twice, as if it might change when she looks away. There is a fire extinguisher by the door with a fresh inspection sticker, and a tiny white detector in the corner with a steady green light. The green dot sits there like a promise, calm and indifferent.

The room is small but clean. The bed is narrow but not punished. There is no heater on the wall, just a small white fan bolted to the ceiling and a window that actually opens without a fight. It looks out onto a courtyard full of plants in chipped pots. The air smells like wet soil and coffee. It is a smell that feels like a promise.

Mara drops her bag and stands by the window for a long minute, letting the air wash over her face. The headache that has been a constant thrum for days seems to move farther away, like someone lowering the volume in a different room. She inhales and feels her chest expand without resistance. It is a simple thing and it makes her want to cry.

"You good?" Hannah asks from the doorway.

"I feel like I can breathe," Mara says. It sounds dramatic. It is also true.

Hannah smiles. "Low bar."

"My bars have been very low," Mara says.

She unpacks in a slow, careful way, stacking her chargers, placing her camera on the desk, setting her laptop down without looking at it for a moment. The oxygen can clinks softly against the wood. She takes it out and sets it on the nightstand, a ridiculous trophy from a ridiculous week. She is about to laugh at it when a soft, steady chirp sounds from somewhere in the hall.

She steps into the hallway and sees a man in a soccer jersey standing on a chair, twisting a smoke detector with exaggerated care while two other guests watch and make helpful, useless comments. He catches her looking and grins. "Battery," he says, as if it's an explanation for everything. The detector chirps again, then goes silent. The man hops down and gives a little bow. The hallway smells like lemon cleaner and fresh towels. The air is cool. It makes her shoulders loosen one notch.

A smoke detector, low battery. The noise is so familiar that it doesn't take thought to place it. In another life, she would have put in the new battery and muttered about lazy maintenance. Now, the sound makes her shoulders tighten. She listens for a second, then lets it go. This building has windows. This building has air. A dead battery is just a dead battery.

She makes herself repeat that until it feels true.

She wanders downstairs while Hannah showers, not ready to be alone in a room that feels too good. The common room here is quiet in a different way, all soft couches and low music instead of the old hostel's loud chaos. A bookshelf holds paperback novels and a stack of board games missing pieces. In the kitchen, a staff member in a gray apron is lighting a stove, the flame a clean blue. Above it, a metal hood hums and pulls air upward with a steady, patient sound. The vent is open. The air moves in a way she can see. The staff member taps a small white box on the wall, listens for the quick chirp, and nods to himself. A test. A habit. A tiny ritual of care.

Mara leans against the counter and watches for a moment longer than she should. She tells herself she's just curious, that she is not damaged goods, that she is not turning into someone who measures safety by the sound of a beep. But her body hums with relief anyway, the kind that sinks into her bones like warm water. She takes a glass of water from the filtered pitcher, sips it, and realizes it doesn't taste like metal. The difference is almost insulting.

She tries to film a quick clip for her followers: "New spot, new start." The words feel stiff in her mouth. She switches to her camera instead of her phone, framing the open window and the little courtyard plants, trying to make the air look like something you can buy. When she watches the clip back, her face looks calmer than she feels. She deletes it, then undeletes it, then leaves it alone. She is tired of deciding what version of herself to show.

---

They go out for food because food is a way of being somewhere else. The rain has eased into mist, the kind that makes the street lights soft and the world look like it was filtered. They find a place with an open front and plastic chairs and the smell of frying oil that is not the heater's sweet breath. Mara orders soup and bread and eats more than she has in days.

On the walk, she notices how many people move through the city as if nothing can touch them. A man balances a crate of eggs on his head without looking up. A woman in a red poncho sells umbrellas and calls out prices like prayers. A bus exhales a cloud of diesel that makes Mara cough, and the cough is sharp and clean, the kind that clears rather than clogs. She is grateful for the difference. She watches a street performer light a candle in a glass jar and use the flame to warm his hands. The flame wavers yellow for a second, then steadies. It is a small detail that lands in her chest like a pebble.

"I didn't realize how little I was eating," she says, and it comes out like a confession.

"You were busy trying not to die," Hannah says, and then smiles to take the sting out of it.

They talk about ordinary things: the museum, the weird mask, the cable car. They avoid the word carbon monoxide as if saying it might invite it back in. Mara catches herself laughing at a joke about a tourist who got lost in the old town, and the laugh feels strange on her tongue, like a muscle she forgot how to use.

A street vendor walks by with a tray of caramelized sugar candies on sticks. The smell is sweet and sharp, and Mara flinches before she can stop herself. The vendor looks at her, confused, and moves on. She feels embarrassed by her own reflex.

"You okay?" Hannah asks.

"Yeah," Mara says. "Smells. It's just... the smell."

She sips her soup and tries to let the sweetness be just sugar and not a warning sign. It isn't the smell that scares her, she realizes, it's how much she has learned to listen for it. Her body has learned a new language. It will not forget it easily.

They walk back with their umbrellas turned inside out by a sudden wind. The new hostel's lobby is quiet and bright. The receptionist nods at them. The chirp from the smoke detector has stopped. Someone must have changed the battery. Mara feels a small, absurd gratitude for anonymous competence.

On the corner before they reach the hostel, a pharmacy window displays a tower of smoke detectors and a stack of AA batteries. Mara slows without meaning to. The clean plastic discs look harmless, like toys. She almost goes in to buy one, as if carrying it would make her feel safer, then remembers she doesn't need it here. She keeps walking anyway, and the thought follows her like a shadow that has learned her shape.

In the courtyard, a couple of guests are sharing a bottle of wine under a string of small yellow lights. The lights are new, the kind that don't flicker. A man with a camera strap around his neck asks where she's been in Ecuador, and when she says the old hostel, he whistles low. "My cousin stayed there last year," he says. "He woke up with a headache every day and blamed the altitude. He left after two nights. Said the air felt dirty." He shrugs, like it's just another travel story. It lands in Mara's chest like a weight anyway.

She smiles and makes the polite noise people make when they don't want to spiral in public. She excuses herself and goes upstairs, the lightness in her lungs suddenly fragile, like a soap bubble she has to carry without popping.

In the bathroom of her new room, she splashes water on her face. When she looks up, she sees her lips are a little too pink, a flushed, healthy color that doesn't match how tired she feels. She presses a finger to them, then pulls it away. The color stays. She tells herself it's the warm soup, the walk, the relief. She tells herself that the clinic is behind her now.

She pulls on clean clothes and sits at the desk to answer the sponsor email she has been avoiding. The laptop glow makes her eyes ache. She types a polite reply about bandwidth and delays, about jet lag and content coming soon. She adds a smiling emoji because it's easier than explaining that her body has been slowly starved of oxygen for days. She hits send and feels nothing.

She opens her notes app and makes another list, because lists feel like guardrails. CHARGE PHONE. FIND PASSPORT. SLEEP. BREATHE. The last word looks childish on the screen. She leaves it anyway. The fan above shifts and sends a slow breath down over her hair. It is steady and ordinary, and it makes her angry at how little she trusts ordinary now.

Her phone is still dead. She plugs it into the wall and watches the battery icon flicker to life. It shows two percent and a tiny lightning bolt. She lets it charge and tries not to look at it too often. She does anyway.

When it powers on, there are three notifications: a message from her mother, a missed call from a number she doesn't recognize, and a text from the blank account.

You left it.

Mara stares at the words until they lose their shape. She doesn't know what it means and she hates that someone thinks they do. She closes the message and opens her mother's text instead. Are you okay? It was sent two hours ago, like a hand reaching across a gap. Mara types back, Safe now. New hostel. Phone died. and adds a heart. It feels like lying and also like telling the truth.

She sets the phone face down and rests her forehead on her palms. The room is quiet. The fan above whispers. The window is open and the air moves. She should feel safe. She feels restless instead.

---

She is half asleep when she remembers the passport.

It comes in a flash, like a light turned on in a dark room. The receptionist's hand. The word tomorrow. The empty pocket. Her stomach drops. She sits up, heart thudding, and pulls her bag onto the bed. She unzips every pocket, turning the bag inside out. The passport is not there. She checks her jacket. She checks her camera bag. She checks the laptop sleeve. Nothing.

"You okay?" Hannah calls from the next room. They have adjacent rooms, a small mercy.

Mara opens the door. "I can't find my passport," she says.

Hannah's eyebrows lift. She crosses the hall in socked feet, already reaching for the bag. "It has to be there."

They dump the contents onto the bed: chargers, cords, the oxygen can, a bundle of socks, a granola bar crushed into crumbs. Mara feels her pulse in her ears as she pats every seam. Hannah checks the pockets with a calm thoroughness that makes Mara feel both grateful and ashamed.

Mara lifts the receipt from the old hostel, the paper wrinkled from being folded too many times. Her name is there, the date, the refund amount, the manager's neat signature. She flips it over, half expecting to see her passport taped to the back like a forgotten boarding pass. Nothing. The paper is soft from her thumb, a little damp from the rain. It feels like evidence that she left, and also proof that she might have left something behind.

She checks her jacket again, then the lining of her camera bag, then the small pocket she never uses because it's too small for anything important. The pocket yields a coin and a cough drop and not the one thing she needs. Her mouth is dry. She takes a sip of water and it tastes like plastic, which makes her think of the hostel's bottled water and the way she used it to wash her face when the pipes were dry.

"Did you have it when we checked in?" Hannah asks.

"I had the scan," Mara says. "Not the actual one." She sees the window again, the closed latch, the heater on. She sees herself signing the refund form at the old hostel's desk. She sees the passport in her hand, the way she tucked it under the receipt. Or did she? The memory is fogged and sticky.

"It could be in your old room," Hannah says, and it's not a question.

Mara sits down hard on the edge of the bed. The mattress squeaks. The word room makes her throat tighten.

She thinks about passports the way she thinks about air now: invisible until it's gone. It is a small rectangle that holds her name and her face, a paper permission slip to be anywhere else. Without it, the new hostel becomes another room she might have to leave in a hurry. Without it, she is a person with no proof that she belongs anywhere, not even in her own story. She presses her palms to her eyes and sees the old hostel's hallway, the taped vents, the yellow warning sticker. The room is a stamp she can't get rid of.

She considers calling her mother for advice and then doesn't, because she doesn't want to explain why she might have left her passport in a room with a gas heater. She doesn't want to say the word poisoning out loud to someone who loves her. She can handle fear in her own head. She doesn't want to hand it to someone else.

She opens the backpack once more and spreads it open like a wound, searching by feel. Her fingers brush the edge of her notebook, the one she keeps for captions and ideas. She opens it and finds a card from the old hostel tucked inside, a small white card with ROOM 9 written in black marker. It looks like a tag from a morgue. She closes the notebook and puts it away.

"I can go with you in the morning," Hannah says. "We can tell them to let us grab it."

"They said I need it by tomorrow," Mara says. The weight of it presses on her chest. She imagines the receptionist's polite smile, the rule on the clipboard. She imagines a new day, a new complication, a new reason to go back. She doesn't want to add a passport to the list of things she is losing.

Hannah sits beside her, shoulder touching hers. "We can go now," she says. "It's a twenty-minute walk. We get it, we come back, you're done."

The words now and go and back ring in Mara's head like a bell she doesn't want to hear. She pictures the old hostel sign, the flicker in the rain. She pictures the hallway heat and the taped vents. She pictures the heater's blue eye opening by itself. She pictures the message: See you tonight.

She looks at her phone, still charging on the desk. The blank message is still there. You left it. A simple line, a sharp hook.

"What if it's not there?" she says.

"Then we come back and deal with it," Hannah says. "But it probably is. You were packing fast. You were sick. It makes sense." Hannah's voice is steady, but there is a tension in it, a thin line of worry she is trying not to show.

Mara picks up her phone and dials the old hostel. The call rings three times before someone answers. A voice says "Hola," bored and clipped, the same cadence as the receptionist. Mara clears her throat. "Hi. I checked out today. I think I left my passport in room nine." She hates how small her voice sounds.

"You need to come," the voice says. There is a shuffling sound in the background, metal on metal. "We cannot check rooms for you."

"Can you look? Please?" she asks.

"Come to reception," the voice says, and then hangs up. The line goes dead with a soft click that feels like a door closing.

Mara takes a breath. The air in this room is clean, but the thought of leaving it feels like stepping back into a storm. She knows she has to. She doesn't know if she can.

She stands. Her knees feel loose. She grabs her jacket, the beanie, her phone, the room key. Her hand hesitates over the oxygen can, then drops it into her pocket with a soft clink. A talisman. A joke. A comfort.

She catches her reflection in the mirror by the door and pauses. Her eyes look brighter than they have all week, like someone turned the contrast up, but the skin around them is hollow. The pink in her lips is gone now, replaced by a pale line she recognizes from long flights and cheap hostels and the way stress erases you. She sticks her tongue out at her reflection, a childish gesture, and it makes her laugh once, a short bark of sound. The laugh feels like something she can carry with her.

On the desk, her list stares back: CHARGE PHONE. FIND PASSPORT. SLEEP. BREATHE. She adds a fifth item with a pen she stole from reception. LEAVE. The letters look too neat for a word that feels so messy. She underlines it anyway, as if she can force her body to believe her own handwriting.

"We go, we grab it, we come back," she says. She says it like a spell.

Hannah nods. "And if anyone tells you to close a window, you tell them to get bent," she says, and the bluntness makes Mara laugh, short and real.

They step into the hallway. The air is cooler than the old hostel's hallway, but the memory of heat still sits on her skin. They walk down the stairs and out into the mist. The streetlights blur. The city smells like wet stone and exhaust.

As they walk, Mara tries to name the thing inside her that keeps pulling her back to bad rooms and bad decisions. Pride is part of it, sure, but pride is too tidy a word. It is the need to be the kind of person who can handle anything, the kind of traveler who can sleep anywhere and laugh about it later. It is the fear of being small in a world that already feels too big. It is the voice of her channel and her followers and her own internal scoreboard, all whispering that leaving early means you failed. She knows, logically, that none of that matters. She also knows that logic doesn't always get the final say.

She watches a taxi splash through a puddle and thinks about how quickly water fills a space when it decides it belongs there. She thinks about air in the same way, how it can become something else without a sound. She hates that her brain keeps returning to it, the way a tongue keeps touching a sore tooth. She wants to be done with the old hostel. She wants to be done with the word monoxide. She wants to be done with that sweet smell that now lives in her memory like a ghost she can't exorcise.

The oxygen can in her pocket knocks against her hip with each step, a small metallic reminder that she is carrying her own air like contraband. She thinks of the clinic mask, the hiss of oxygen like a whispered secret, and how good it felt to let someone else be responsible for her breathing. She thinks of the messages that kept arriving like knocks on a door she didn't answer. Tonight. Not tonight. You left it. The words have rehearsed themselves in her head, a script she doesn't want to perform but has somehow memorized.

As they turn the corner, Mara's phone buzzes. The screen lights in her hand, a new message popping up before she can brace for it.

Room nine.

She stops walking. Hannah takes another step and then turns back, sees the look on Mara's face, and stops too.

Mara looks up the street. The old hostel is out of sight, but she can imagine the sign flickering anyway. The message is four characters and a number, and it feels like a door clicking shut behind her.

She closes her hand around the phone and keeps walking, because her passport is missing, because rules are rules, because she is still trying to be a person who finishes what she starts.

The rain thickens, and the city swallows the light.
