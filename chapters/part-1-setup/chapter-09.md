# Chapter 09: The Night Shift

The heater is breathing in there, slow and patient, like a dog that knows you will eventually come home.

Mara keeps her hand on the knob. The door is warm under her palm, a surprising heat through cheap paint. The text on her phone still glows: Tonight. The hallway around her is dark and empty. The power outage hasn't started yet, or maybe it has and the emergency lights are the ones telling the lie. The hallway smells sweet, that burnt-sugar smell she can't stop noticing. She hates that her body now does an inventory of air before it does anything else.

She takes a breath. It tastes like metal and dust. She turns the knob.

The room is warm in a way that feels personal. The heater's blue eye is open, its flame steady. The window is closed. The stool she wedged yesterday is pushed aside. The water bottle on the sill is gone, standing upright on the desk as if someone moved it to be helpful. The fan she left on the desk is unplugged, cord coiled neat.

"Nope," she says, too loud in the small room.

She crosses to the heater and flicks the switch off. The flame dies with a soft sigh. The ticking stops. The silence feels like the room is holding its breath.

She goes to the window and forces it open. It resists like a jaw unclenching. Cold air slips in, a damp slap that makes her scalp prickle. She wedges the stool against the sill, then puts the water bottle back where it was, braced at an angle. It looks like a small barricade against a heavy idea.

She looks at the fan and hesitates. If she plugs it in, it will be useless when the power goes out in a few minutes. She plugs it in anyway, because the whir of movement is a reassurance. The blades spin up, a thin wind pushing toward the open window. It's a bad metaphor for control. It's the only one she's got.

Her phone buzzes again. Another message from the blank account.

Maintenance starts at one. Doors stay shut.

Mara swallows. Her throat is dry and her pulse is loud in her ears. She stares at the line as if it might rearrange itself into a joke. The word maintenance is the kind of word that can hide anything in it. She types back before she can stop herself.

Who are you?

The message sends. Seen. No answer.

She steps back into the hallway and pulls the door closed behind her, then reopens it, just to make sure it isn't a soft click that could lock her out. The hallway feels warmer now, or maybe she is. She wants to run, but running would look like a thing that needs explaining. She doesn't have the energy for explaining.

Halfway down the corridor she hears footsteps, slow and regular, like a metronome. A man turns the corner, a key ring in his hand. He isn't the receptionist; this one is older, with a thin mustache and a puffy jacket over his uniform shirt. He has a flashlight that he doesn't use.

He sees her and pauses, and in that pause she can feel the math of risk in his eyes.

"You are in room nine," he says, like it's a fact he's been given and not a question.

"Yeah," she says. "I just needed to... check something. The heater."

He nods once, as if he hears this every night. "Windows must be closed after one," he says.

"No," she says, and the word comes out hard. "Doctor said I need it open." She hears her voice and wishes it were steadier.

He looks at her, then past her into the room. The fan hums, a small, electric creature. "Open window, then no heater," he says. It's a rule, it's a warning, it's a shrug. He doesn't care which it is.

"The heater turned itself on," she says. It isn't an accusation. It should be.

He shrugs anyway. "Gas keeps warm. Rooms get cold at night. We turn off later." He lifts the key ring slightly, as if to prove the turning-off exists as a concept. He doesn't offer to come in, to check, to make it right. He just stands there, the power of a hallway key set and a tired face.

"Who is closing the windows?" she asks.

"Security," he says. The word is a wall. "People steal. Window open, someone climbs. You want safe, you close. You want air, you open." He says the line like a prayer.

She wants to argue, to say that the air is part of safe, that a warm room with a closed window is not a safe room, that this is not a game of either/or. But the argument will go nowhere. It will be absorbed by the damp walls and come back as a shrug.

"Do what you need," he says, and then he walks on, the key ring clinking softly. His footsteps fade into the heat.

Mara stands in the doorway for a moment, the fan humming, the cold air creeping in. She thinks about sleeping in this room again. She thinks about the night note that said power would go out. She thinks about the fact that gas doesn't need electricity. She thinks about the way the heater looked alive when she walked in, and the way the window was closed like a mouth that had just swallowed something.

She pulls the door shut and locks it, because if someone is going to close her window, she wants it to be obvious. She picks up her phone and her room key and walks back down the hallway to the dorm, keeping her hand against the wall as if it might tip.

In the dorm, the septum-ring girl is asleep on her stomach, her phone glowing under her pillow. The other bunks are lumps of blankets and breathing. The window is still propped with Mara's shoe. Cold air filters in. She slides into her lower bunk and checks her phone again, as if the blank account might have suddenly decided to be a person.

Nothing.

She sets her alarm for 1:05. She isn't sure what she expects to do at 1:05, but it feels better than waiting.

She lies back and stares at the slats above her head. The bunk squeaks. The air is cold and damp and normal enough that her body starts to soften. She tells herself she is safe. She tells herself she has done the responsible thing. She tells herself she is leaving in the morning.

At 12:59, the power goes out.

The dorm breathes in unison, a collective pause. Phone screens blink, then go dark. Someone curses softly in German. The fan in the corner dies mid-whir. The emergency light above the door flickers on, a low, greenish glow that makes everyone's faces look unwell.

Mara sits up, heart racing. The air changes almost immediately. It isn't warmer yet, but it feels used, like a room that has been held too long. She listens. Somewhere down the hall, a door opens and closes. Another door. Footsteps. The sound of a key ring again.

She gets up and steps into the aisle between bunks. Her legs feel heavy. The dark does something to her balance. She grabs her hoodie and slips it on. The air is getting colder from the window and warmer from the bodies, a strange mix that makes her skin prickle.

She should go back to her room and check the heater again, she thinks. She should go outside. She should stay in the dorm and not make a scene. The three thoughts fight for space. The emergency light flickers again. She decides to stay. The hallway is probably darker, and the idea of moving through it in a building that smells like gas feels like a bad movie decision.

The window creaks.

She turns. The shoe is still there, but the window has inched closed, the frame pulling in as if it has a slow, patient will. Someone in the top bunk shifts, pulling a blanket over their head, and the movement nudges the bed frame. The shoe slips. The window drops another inch.

"Hey," Mara whispers, and reaches for it. The cold air claws at her fingers. She pushes it open again, tightens the shoe in place, then takes her beanie off and wedges it between the sill and the frame. The beanie is a soft sacrifice. She doesn't know if it will hold. She doesn't have anything else.

The dorm settles again. Someone snores. Someone mutters in a language she doesn't recognize. The air is still.

Mara climbs back into her bunk and lies on her back, eyes open. Her phone alarm buzzes in the dark, a low vibration, but there's no light to tell her the time. She turns it off and keeps listening.

She can hear the hallway heaters ticking even without power. The sound is soft but constant. It makes her feel like the building has a pulse.

She tries to count breaths, a trick the clinic nurse mentioned while adjusting the oxygen mask. In for four, out for six. It works for a few cycles until she notices the air tasting like warm pennies again. She presses her face into the pillow and then pulls back, because the pillow smells like detergent and sleep and someone else's scalp. She wants to be out of this room and also wants the room to behave. She wants it to stay as it is, with the window open and the air moving, and she wants it to be true that nothing bad can happen to you if you are doing the right thing. Her mind knows better. Her body keeps rehearsing the old lesson anyway.

She keeps her eyes open until they blur. She tells herself she will stay awake. She tells herself she will listen for the heater in her room. She tells herself a lot of things that are hard to keep holding in the dark.

She drifts. It isn't sleep. It's a thin, shallow float.

In it, she hears a door click. She hears footsteps. She hears a soft metallic scrape, like tape being smoothed down. She hears someone breathe close to her ear. She opens her eyes, or thinks she does, and sees nothing but the emergency light's green haze. She doesn't know if the sounds are real or if her brain is filling the quiet with stories.

Her head begins to ache, a slow throb like a drum heard from far away. She presses her palm to her temple and tries to focus on her breathing. The air is colder now. The beanie in the window holds, barely. A thin draft runs across her face. She clings to it like a rope.

At some point, the power returns. The fan in the corner coughs to life. The dorm's ceiling light flickers once and then stays dark, as if the switch is off but the current is back. The emergency light fades out. Phones blink awake. The room fills with the small electronic whine of chargers reclaiming their task.

Mara checks her phone. 2:17 a.m. The outage lasted longer than she expected. She sits up and blinks her eyes clear. The headache is there, but small, like a thumbprint pressed into her skull. She is tired in a way that feels earned.

Her phone buzzes. A message.

Still awake?

She stares at it. Her hands feel slow. She types back.

Yes.

The reply is immediate.

Don't go back in there.

"In where?" she whispers, to the dark. She types it instead.

In where?

Seen. No answer.

She lies back down and laughs once, a small, humorless sound. The dorm smells like bodies and damp fabric. The cold air from the window feels like a gift. She pulls the blanket up and tries to sleep, the kind that isn't floating.

---

Morning arrives like a guilty party, late and quiet and pretending nothing happened.

Mara wakes to the same chorus of hostel mornings: zippers, whispers, a phone alarm that won't shut up. The dorm is gray with early light. The beanie is still in the window, damp and misshapen. The air is cold and clean enough to make her feel almost normal.

Her headache is there, but it isn't a helmet. It is a stubborn knot. She sits up and stretches her shoulders, feeling the stiffness in her neck. Her phone says 7:22. Messages line up like a queue.

Hannah: You alive?
Mom: All good??
Blank account: You should be gone.

The last one hits like a slap. She stares at it until the words blur. She feels a moment of anger, sharp and clean. Whoever this is doesn't get to tell her where to be. Whoever this is doesn't get to decide if she should be gone. She types back.

Are you in the hostel?

Seen. No answer.

She swings her legs down and feels the cold tile bite her feet. She shoves them into her shoes and grabs her bag. The oxygen can clinks inside. She considers taking it out and decides not to. The dorm smells like someone sprayed lavender too aggressively. She steps into the hallway and is met by a wave of warm air.

The heaters in the hall are on again. The air smells sweet. She pauses and presses her hand to the wall. It is warmer than it should be for morning. She feels the old anger rise and tries to push it down. She is leaving today. It doesn't matter if the hallway is a sauna. It doesn't matter if the air tastes like pennies. It only matters that she gets out.

The stairs are crowded. A group of Australians are joking about the power outage and the lack of hot showers. Someone complains that their phone died. Someone else says, "At least we didn't die in our sleep, eh?" and laughs too loudly. Mara smiles because that's what you do when someone makes a joke about dying that isn't yours.

In the common room, Hannah is at the long table with a mug and her guidebook, like she has been there all night. She looks up when Mara enters, relief and annoyance in equal measure.

"You alive," Hannah says.

"Barely," Mara says. She drops into the chair across from her. "Power outage." She doesn't add the rest.

"I heard the hallway was a furnace," Hannah says. "Everyone was up at one, cursing in four languages." She studies Mara's face. "You okay?"

Mara wants to say yes. She wants to say no. She settles for the truth she can carry. "I'm tired. I'm checking out."

Hannah nods, sharp. "Good. I found a place with a private room and a proper window. It's more expensive, but we can split the first night if you want." She flips her guidebook open, showing a sticky note with an address. "They have actual smoke detectors. I asked."

Mara smiles, grateful. She also feels the weight of money in her pocket like a stone. "Let me talk to the manager," she says. "If they process the refund, I'll go. If not..."

"If not, we still go," Hannah says. "Your pride can sleep in your old bed if it wants to. You don't have to."

Mara laughs because it's true and because it hurts. "Okay," she says. "Let me try."

The manager is at the desk, clipboard in hand, talking to a couple about a tour. He smiles when he sees her, the same polite smile that doesn't reach his eyes.

"Checking out?" he asks.

"Yes," Mara says. "You said you would refund one night." She keeps her voice even, like asking for a receipt.

He nods and gestures toward the computer. The screen is black. He taps it. Nothing. He taps the keyboard. It doesn't light. He sighs in a way that could be apologetic if it tried.

"Power came back, but system is down," he says. "We cannot process refund now. You come later."

"Later when?" Mara asks.

He shrugs. It's a different shrug than the receptionist's. It's managerial. "Maybe afternoon. You can wait in common room. Or you can check out and come back later."

"If I check out, you won't let me back in," Mara says.

"You can come to reception," he says. "We keep luggage. It's okay." He smiles again, a customer service mask. "We are very safe."

Mara feels her teeth press together. Safe is a word that has lost its meaning in this building. She looks past him to the bulletin board. The security notice is still there, fresh and cheerful. The padlocks grin.

"Is the heater in my room on now?" she asks.

The manager's smile thins. "No heater in morning," he says. "Only night. It is cold. It is normal." He taps the clipboard as if the rules are printed there. "We follow rules."

"Whose rules?" she asks, and immediately regrets it because it sounds like a challenge. She isn't sure she has the energy for a fight.

He looks at her for a long second. "House rules," he says. "You want different, you go."

The line is a door opening. She steps through it, even if she wants to slam it behind her. "I am going," she says.

He nods. "Come later for refund," he says, and then he turns to the next guest.

Mara stands there for a beat, stunned by how easy he makes it to leave. It makes her want to stay out of spite. It makes her want to leave out of survival. She turns and walks back toward the stairs, her bag heavy on her shoulder.

Hannah watches her return. "Well?"

"System's down," Mara says. "He says come back later."

Hannah makes a face. "That's convenient." She flips her guidebook closed. "We can pack and go. If he can't refund now, that's his problem."

Mara looks at her camera bag. She looks at the charging station on the wall, her cables snaking out from it. She looks at the Wi-Fi password written in marker, the only thing in this building that has been consistent. She thinks about the video she has to edit and the sponsor email she ignored. She thinks about leaving without the refund and feeling like a fool. She thinks about the sleep she didn't get and the air she did.

"I need ten minutes to pack," she says.

"I'll help," Hannah says.

They go upstairs together. The hallway is even warmer now, the heat radiating from the walls. The sweet smell is back, stronger. It makes Mara's stomach clench. Hannah wrinkles her nose. "It's worse," she says, low.

Mara unlocks her room. The door sticks. When it opens, a pocket of warm air presses out, heavy and damp. The heater is on.

Mara stops. The blue flame flickers behind the glass window, steady and complacent. The window is closed. The stool is pushed aside again, the water bottle on the floor. The fan is still plugged in but silent.

She doesn't say anything. She just walks to the heater and switches it off. The flame dies. She opens the window and the cold air rushes in. She wedges the stool back in place and sets the bottle on the sill. Her movements are quick, practiced now, like a ritual that keeps something away.

Hannah stands in the doorway, eyes on the heater. "They keep turning it on," she says.

"Yeah," Mara says. "They keep closing the window."

"We leave," Hannah says. It's not a suggestion.

Mara nods. She starts to pack, throwing clothes into her bag, wrapping cables around her hand, shoving her tripod into the side pocket. The room feels smaller with the open window, the cold air taking up space. Her breath fogs in front of her mouth. The air is clean. The headache eases by a notch. She tries not to read into it.

She grabs her laptop and then pauses. The metal is warm. The lid is open, the screen dark. She closed it last night. She feels a chill that is not from the cold.

"Did you come in here?" she asks Hannah, already knowing the answer.

"No," Hannah says. "Why?"

Mara shakes her head. "Nothing." She closes the laptop and slides it into her bag. It might have been the heat. It might have been the room's warmth. It might have been nothing. She doesn't have the energy to assign meaning to it now.

She zips the bag and stands. The room is still warm despite the open window, as if it doesn't want to let go. She picks up her camera. She looks at the heater one more time.

On the floor near it, a strip of tape lies curled, shiny and new. It wasn't there last night. It looks like a piece peeled off in a hurry.

Mara picks it up between two fingers. It is warm.

She drops it like it burned.

---

By noon, the rain has started again, a steady whisper against the roof. The courtyard is damp and empty, the hammock wet. Mara and Hannah sit in the common room with their bags by their feet, waiting for the manager to be available, waiting for the system to return from whatever maintenance limbo it has drifted into.

Mara opens her laptop to use the Wi-Fi one last time. She checks her email and finds a message from a sponsor with a subject line that reads, "Quick question!" which is code for urgent. She doesn't answer it. She opens her video timeline and stares at it. The footage from the rooftop looks bright and airy. The footage from the hallway is unwatchable, dark and shaky, like it wants to be a horror film. She deletes nothing.

The manager walks by with a clipboard and a paper cup. He doesn't look at her.

Mara checks her phone. A new message from the blank account has arrived.

You won't get your refund if you leave.

Her stomach flips. She looks up at the manager, then at the receptionist, then at the back door. The message feels like a hand on the small of her back, steering her. She wants to throw the phone across the room. Instead she types.

Is this the manager?

Seen. No answer.

She stands. "I'm going," she says to Hannah. "Refund or not."

Hannah stands too, quicker. "Good."

They walk to the desk together. The manager is there now, the computer screen lit. She asks for the refund again. He taps keys, frowns, taps again. The printer coughs and spits out a receipt. He slides it across the counter with a small, resigned motion. "Here," he says. "One night."

Mara takes it. The paper is warm, like it has just been breathed on. She counts the cash in her hand and feels the relief like a small, guilty pulse.

"Thank you," she says, because she is not sure what else to say.

He nods and turns away.

Outside, the rain is cold and persistent. They step onto the sidewalk with their bags and the damp air hits Mara's face like a baptism. She sucks in a breath and feels her lungs open. The city smells like wet stone and diesel. It smells alive.

They make it two blocks before Mara's phone buzzes again. Another message.

See you tonight.

She stops walking. The words blur for a second, then sharpen. She reads them again, as if repetition might make them less real. Hannah looks at her, questions already in her eyes.

"What?" Hannah asks.

Mara turns the phone so she can see. Hannah reads it, her jaw tight.

"No," Hannah says. "Absolutely not." She tightens her grip on her bag. "We're not going back."

Mara knows that. She knows it in the same way she knows she shouldn't have stayed this long in the first place. And yet, as they walk toward the new hostel, she feels the message like a tether, a thin string tied to her wrist that is still attached to the old building. It stretches behind her, invisible and stubborn.

She looks over her shoulder once. The hostel's sign flickers in the rain. A window on the second floor slides shut.

Mara keeps walking anyway.

The rain gets heavier. The street goes quiet. Her phone vibrates again, and when she looks, the screen is black.
