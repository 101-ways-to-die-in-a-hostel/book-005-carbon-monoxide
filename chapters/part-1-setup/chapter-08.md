# Chapter 08: Borrowed Breath

Mara wakes to the sound of someone apologizing in five languages, which is a very hostel way to start a morning.

A girl on the bunk above her is whispering a stream of sorries because her phone alarm went off at 5 a.m. and no one had the heart to throw it out the window. Mara blinks at the underside of the bunk, a lattice of cheap wood and duct tape, and tries to decide if her headache is worse or just different. The air in the dorm is cold and wet and full of human breath. It smells like wet socks and shampoo and the antiseptic lavender spray someone has gone hard on. It is not fresh. It is also not her room, which is enough for now.

She reaches for her phone and sees the message again, the one that sat behind her eyes all night: Not tonight.

It isn't from a name, just the same blank account, the same string of numbers. She stares at it, the screen a bright square in the dim, and feels a thin line of anger cut through her sleep. Not tonight, like someone is doing her a favor. Not tonight, like they get to decide.

She thumbs a reply before she thinks too hard. Who are you?

The message sends, little gray checkmarks that turn into a pair of blue ones. Seen. No answer. The emptiness feels like a door left open in a storm.

Above her, the alarm finally stops. Someone groans. A zipper screams. The dorm exhales, and the day begins with the slow shuffle of people leaving. Mara stays still until the crush of morning passes, then slides off the bunk. Her feet hit cold tile, and the chill makes her lungs pinch. She pulls on her hoodie and the knit beanie she bought yesterday. It makes her look like someone who has made a choice, which she hasn't.

The window in the dorm is cracked and wedged with a shoe. She steps toward it and lets the outside air wash across her face. It smells like rain and bus exhaust and something fried. She inhales slowly, as if she can take a day's worth of oxygen and store it. Her headache dulls by half a notch, enough to notice.

A girl with a septum ring sits up in her bunk and watches her. "You okay?" she asks, voice thick with sleep.

Mara nods. "Altitude," she says, because it is the easiest word to offer and because it is only partially a lie.

The girl shrugs. "Same. Everyone's altitude-sick until they're not." She flops back down.

Mara grabs her small bag and tiptoes out. The hallway is warmer than the dorm, a soft breath of heat that feels like a warning now. The heaters in the corridor tick, and the faint sweet smell lingers like a ghost of burnt sugar. She keeps her hand on the rail as she takes the stairs.

In the common room, the morning is a low, gray hum. Someone is frying eggs. Someone is arguing about buses. Hannah is already at the long table, a guidebook open, a mug in hand, eyes too bright for the hour. When she sees Mara, her shoulders drop just a fraction.

"Good," Hannah says. "You're upright. I was about to come drag you out by the ankles. Very on brand for me."

Mara sits across from her and wraps her hands around the mug Hannah slides her way. The coffee is burned and perfect. "I slept," she says. "Not great, but... alive."

Hannah glances up the stairs. "They didn't notice you in the dorm?"

"Not yet." Mara keeps her voice light. The truth is she doesn't know if she was allowed to be there. She didn't ask. She can't tell if that makes her brave or rude.

Hannah taps her guidebook. "I found two other hostels within walking distance. Both have private rooms. Both cost more. Both seem to have fewer heaters."

"Less heat," Mara says, a tired joke. "More money."

"More air," Hannah says. "Which is the entire point." She doesn't push, but the look she gives Mara is a push anyway.

Mara sips her coffee and lets the heat settle in her hands. The common room smells like toast and damp clothes. It isn't fresh, but it isn't the sweet hot smell from upstairs either. It makes her head hurt in a different way.

"I'll go look," Mara says, and hears how small it sounds. "Later. I need my camera and laptop." She hates that the sentence ends with her job, as if her job is a reason to go back into the room that keeps trying to take her out.

Hannah nods. "I'll come with you. And if you say the word, we check out. No more shrugging from men with tape."

Mara smiles, grateful and exhausted. "Deal," she says. It is easier to agree to a plan than to follow it.

---

Upstairs, the hallway is warmer than it should be for a damp morning. The heat is a low presence, like someone standing too close behind you. The vent above Mara's door gleams with fresh tape. It looks newer than yesterday, the aluminum a clean, bright slash against the stained plaster. Someone has been busy in the night.

Her door sticks as she unlocks it. When it opens, a pocket of cold air hits her face, but underneath it she catches the metallic sweetness and the damp, moldy smell of wet fabric. The room looks the same and not the same, like it has been moved half an inch while she wasn't looking.

The window is closed.

She stops in the doorway, one hand still on the knob. She is sure she left it open, stool braced, water bottle for weight. The stool is still there, but it has been pushed aside. The water bottle lies on its side, cap off, a small puddle darkening the tile.

"No," she says, out loud, to the room. It doesn't answer.

She crosses to the window and shoves it open. It squeals, reluctant. The cold air rushes in, a slap and a relief. She picks up the bottle, screws the cap back on, and wedges the stool against the window again, harder this time. She puts the bottle on the sill as an extra weight. It looks like a tiny fort against a huge problem.

Her fan is still on the desk, plugged in. She turns it on. It hums weakly, pushing air toward the open window. It feels like breathing through a straw and pretending it's a mouthful.

She reaches for her laptop and stops. The metal casing is warm, as if it has been used. She left it off. The screen is dark. She touches it anyway, then pulls her hand back. It makes her skin crawl, like someone has been in here when she wasn't.

She checks her camera. The lens cap is off. She puts it back on and tries to tell herself she is being paranoid. People steal chargers, not air. People steal phones, not headaches. But the closed window feels like a hand over her mouth, and she doesn't know whose hand it is.

A knock at the door makes her jump. She opens it to find the cleaner, a woman in a blue apron with red eyes, holding a stack of towels. She glances past Mara into the room, then at the window.

"Ventana," she says, pointing. Her tone is gentle, but her eyes are sharp.

"I keep it open," Mara says.

The cleaner nods, then makes a motion with her hands, palms pressed together, like closing a book. "Seguridad," she says. Security. Then she makes a motion like breathing, a hand moving toward her mouth. "Aire," she says. Air. She looks at Mara like she is offering a choice she doesn't want to offer.

"They tell you to close it," Mara says.

The cleaner's mouth twists. She shakes her head, a small, tired movement. She touches the tape above the vent and says something in Spanish that Mara doesn't catch. The word peligro is clear, though. Danger. The cleaner presses the towels tighter against her chest and walks away.

Mara closes the door with a gentle click. She stands in the middle of the room and listens. The heater is off, the window open, the fan humming. The room should be safe now. It still feels wrong, like a mouth in the wall waiting for the right time to speak.

She packs her laptop and camera into her bag, taking only what she needs. She leaves her hard drive and tripod. The idea of moving everything still feels like an admission she isn't ready to make. She takes a photo of the closed window and the toppled bottle on her phone, a small piece of evidence that she doesn't know who she's keeping it for.

In the hallway, she finds Hannah leaning against the rail, arms crossed. "Everything okay?" Hannah asks.

"Someone closed my window," Mara says.

Hannah's eyebrows lift. "Staff?"

"Who knows." Mara tries to shrug. It comes out as a stiff movement. "Maybe the wind. Maybe the security sign."

"You're not sleeping there again," Hannah says.

Mara wants to agree without qualification, but her mouth stalls. "We'll check those other places," she says instead, and lets it be the compromise it is.

They head downstairs. As they pass the stairwell, the receptionist is taping a fresh copy of the security notice to the wall. KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED AFTER 9 P.M. The little padlocks smile along the bottom. The receptionist sees them and nods, as if they are allies in a shared task. Mara feels something hard and bright rise behind her eyes. She does not say anything. Not yet.

---

The first hostel they visit is bright and clean, the kind of clean that smells like citrus and money. The receptionist smiles too widely and hands them a laminated sheet with prices that make Mara swallow. The private rooms are small, but the windows are large, and she can feel her body lean toward them.

"We can do a dorm," Hannah whispers.

Mara imagines a dorm with six people and a window that doesn't close. She imagines her laptop on a shared table, her gear scattered, her life exposed. She imagines being safe and not in control. She doesn't know which image she hates more.

"I'll think about it," Mara says.

The second place is cheaper and louder. The lobby smells like beer and sunscreen. The manager is friendly in a way that feels practiced, and when Mara asks about heaters, he shrugs and says, "No heaters. We have extra blankets. Quito is cold but not that cold." He smiles like he has solved a problem she didn't ask about.

She leaves with a folded rate sheet in her pocket and a sense that this could be the exit she needs if she can convince herself to take it.

On the walk back, the city rains lightly, a steady mist that slicks the sidewalks and softens the noise. They stop at a cafe with an open front. The smell of bread and coffee is warm and familiar. Mara sits by the doorway to keep the air moving. She sips coca tea and watches people pass, their umbrellas bobbing like dark flowers.

Hannah watches her over the rim of her mug. "You don't have to be loyal to a bad room," she says.

"It's not loyalty," Mara says. She chews on the word. "It's... momentum."

"Momentum is a terrible roommate," Hannah says.

Mara laughs, the sound surprised out of her. It feels good to laugh at something that isn't dying. She scrolls her phone while the tea cools. A message from her mother asks if she has picked up the postcards she promised. Mara replies with a photo of a postcard rack and a heart. Another DM pops up from a follower: "My brother got CO poisoning at a hostel in Peru. He thought it was altitude. He almost died. Please be safe." Mara's thumbs hover. She types, "Thank you, I'm being careful," and sends it. The words feel thin.

Her phone buzzes again. A reply from the blank account.

You left the window open. Someone closed it.

Mara's stomach drops. She stares at the message. Her first instinct is to respond, but she doesn't want to have a conversation with a ghost. She shows Hannah instead.

"That's creepy," Hannah says. "How do they know?"

"Maybe they're guessing," Mara says. It doesn't feel like a guess.

Hannah leans back. "Okay. We assume they're a creep. We still leave."

Mara nods. She keeps nodding even after the message fades into her inbox.

---

Back at the hostel, the lobby is louder. A group is assembling for a walking tour. The manager is giving directions in a booming voice. The security notice is still on the wall, a fresh version taped over the one she ripped down yesterday. Mara stares at it until the letters blur. KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED. THANK YOU.

She walks to the desk, Hannah at her shoulder.

"Did someone go into my room this morning?" Mara asks. She keeps her voice even.

The receptionist looks up, chewing. "Cleaning," he says.

"They closed my window," she says.

"For security," he says.

"Do not close windows," Hannah says, sharp. "Doctor said no."

The receptionist shrugs in a way that makes Mara want to throw her coffee at him. "You choose," he says. "Air or security."

"I'm choosing both," Mara says, and hears how strange that sounds in her own mouth. "If your policy is to close windows, I need another room or a refund." The words come out faster than she can second-guess them.

The receptionist blinks, surprised by her volume. He glances toward the manager. The manager looks back, eyes narrowing. He walks over, clipboard in hand.

"Is there a problem?" he asks, his smile tight.

"My window was closed after I left it open," Mara says. She holds his gaze. "The doctor said not to close it. I don't want the heater on in a closed room."

"We do not turn on heaters when guests are gone," the manager says. He says it like a policy, not a fact. "We close windows for security. We do this for all guests." He gestures toward the sign, as if it is a rule and not a choice.

"Then I want a room with a lockable window that still lets air in," Mara says. "Or I want to leave."

The manager's mouth tightens. "We can refund you tonight," he says. "After that, it is your choice." He turns the clipboard toward her, a page of numbers. The refund is less than she expects, more than she wants to lose.

Mara feels Hannah watching her. She feels the line between pride and survival in her throat. She thinks about the cost, the hassle, the content she needs to make. She thinks about the oxygen mask at the clinic. She thinks about the heater's sweet breath. She thinks about how it felt to breathe in the dorm.

"I'll take the refund," she says.

The manager nods once, as if he expected that. He slides a form across the counter. She signs her name with a shaky hand.

"You check out tomorrow morning," he says. "We will refund one night. You can stay tonight." He smiles again, the same polite smile. "Open window."

Mara nearly laughs. She nearly cries. She does neither.

---

The decision hangs in the air all afternoon, a thin, electric line. Mara moves through the hostel with the feeling that she is already half gone. She edits in the courtyard, the fan pointed at her feet, the air damp and real. She packs in small bursts, folding clothes and leaving them unfolded, making piles that look more like surrender than progress. Every time she passes the stairs, she looks up and sees the tape glinting at the vents, the shiny bandages that still look new.

She goes up to the roof because the air up there feels like a promise. The sky is pale and rinsed, the mountains a bruised line in the distance. She leans on the low wall and breathes until her chest feels less tight. The wind is thin and cold, the kind of discomfort that makes her feel safe. She stays long enough for her headache to soften, long enough to feel like her brain is a room with the windows open.

The compass-tattoo guy comes up while she is there, a backpack slung over one shoulder. He looks better than he did on the couch, color back in his cheeks, a knit beanie pulled low. "You're still here," he says, surprise and something like regret.

"Leaving tomorrow," Mara says.

"Good," he says. He shifts the bag on his shoulder. "They tried to charge me for the clinic, like it was room service. I argued. They shrugged. I left." He laughs once, dry. "I opened every window I passed. If I'm leaving, I can at least leave the air in better shape."

"Did you hear about the power outage tonight?" Mara asks.

"Yeah," he says. "Maintenance. I think that's just what they call the thing they do with the tape." He gestures down toward the building. "You sleeping in the dorm?"

"Tonight," she says. "One more night."

"One more night is always the last one," he says, then softens it with a half-smile. "If you get foggy, get outside. Air fixes everything, even bad decisions."

He heads back down the stairs. Mara watches him go and notices a fresh smear of graffiti on the roof door: a tiny skull with a speech bubble that says BREATHE. Someone has drawn a little heart under it, as if the warning is a cute mantra. The joke feels thin. She touches the cold paint with two fingers and lets it go.

Hannah keeps checking in, offering to help, offering to carry things, offering to drag her to the new place tonight if she wants. Mara keeps saying later. Later is a word that doesn't cost anything until it does.

At dusk, the hostel shifts into its night skin. The common room fills with music and voices. The welcome drink appears in plastic cups. The security notice is now joined by another sign: PLEASE TURN OFF HEATERS BEFORE SLEEP. Someone has drawn a skull in the corner. The skull grins.

Mara takes her bag upstairs to her room to grab the last of her gear. She tells herself it's just a quick run. The hallway is warmer than the lobby, and the sweet smell is back, faint but persistent. She pauses outside room nine and listens. The ticking of heaters in the corridor sounds like tiny clocks.

Inside, the room is cold. The window is open, the stool wedged, the fan humming. The air feels slightly less stale, like it is trying. She turns off the fan to unplug it and the silence is immediate and heavy. She packs her laptop, hard drive, and camera into her bag, the weight of them a familiar burden. She closes the zipper and feels a small relief.

Then she hears it: a soft click, like a switch being flipped, from somewhere in the wall.

She freezes. The heater's glass window glows to life, the blue flame flickering. She didn't touch it. She hasn't been near it. Her hands are still on her bag.

"No," she says, louder this time. She steps toward it and flips the switch off. The flame dies. The room returns to its cold, damp silence. She stands there, breathing, feeling her heart beat in her throat.

Her phone buzzes. A new message from the blank account.

Not tonight, but soon.

Mara stares at it. Her hands shake. The room seems to lean in.

She types back, Stop.

No answer.

She stares at the heater, at the curled warning sticker, at the soot mark she smudged yesterday. She imagines a hand in the wall turning it on while she is not looking. She imagines the wind nudging the window closed while she sleeps. She imagines the note about security and the sign about turning off heaters and the skull grinning at her from the bulletin board.

She picks up her bag and leaves the room without looking back. In the hallway, the heat presses against her as if trying to push her back inside.

She finds Hannah in the common room and tells her what happened. Hannah's eyes go sharp. "We leave now," she says.

"The refund starts tomorrow," Mara says. "If I leave tonight, I lose it."

Hannah stares at her. "Mara."

Mara feels the stubbornness rise again, heavy and hot. The money is small, but it is also rent in a future city. It is groceries. It is pride. It is the difference between being in control and being forced out. She hates that she is thinking about it at all.

"I'll sleep in the dorm again," she says. "I already moved my stuff. I just need one more night."

Hannah shakes her head. "You already know the rule. Air over pride."

"I know," Mara says. She puts her hand on Hannah's arm, a plea and a thank you. "I just need one more night."

Hannah looks at her for a long moment. "Okay," she says finally. "Dorm, window open, no heater. And if anyone tries to close it, you wake me."

Mara nods. "Deal."

---

The dorm is louder at night, a chorus of small noises: a laugh muffled into a pillow, a phone vibrating, the whir of a charger. Mara slides into the lower bunk, her bag under the bed, the oxygen can in her backpack like a ridiculous talisman. She wedges the window open with her shoe again. The air that comes in is cold and wet and perfect. She wraps herself in the blanket and lets the cold settle into her bones. It feels like penance.

The girl with the septum ring is above her, scrolling on her phone. "Why are you in here?" she asks, curiosity casual.

"Private room is haunted," Mara says.

The girl laughs, the sound small and sleepy. "All hostels are haunted," she says, then rolls over.

Mara smiles in the dark. The humor is thin but it holds.

Her phone buzzes one more time. A notification from the hostel's Wi-Fi portal, a system message in crooked English: "Power will be interrupted at 1 a.m. for maintenance. Sorry for the inconvenience." The message is a night note slipped under her door.

She stares at it, the time already late. Power interruption means fans off, lights out, the dorm full of bodies and stale air. It means her private room will be cold and dark. It also means no heater, because there will be no power. The gas heater doesn't need power. The thought lands like a stone.

She considers going back to her room to turn it off at the wall, to make sure. She considers leaving it. The idea of walking the warm hallway at midnight makes her skin prickle. The idea of waking up to a warm room she didn't choose makes her stomach twist.

She sets an alarm for 12:50. She will go, she tells herself. She will be responsible. She will be cautious. She will do all the things she promised herself she would do.

The dorm settles. The air cools. The sounds shift into a sleepy rhythm. Mara's eyelids are heavy. Her head still hums, but the cold air keeps it from deepening. She closes her eyes and lets herself drift, keeping one part of her awake for the alarm.

When it buzzes, she jolts upright, confused for a second about where she is. The dorm is dark, lit only by the blue glow of charging phones. She swings her legs down, shoves her feet into her shoes, and slips into the hallway.

The corridor is warmer, quieter. The heaters along the wall glow faintly. She walks toward room nine with her phone as a light. The hallway smells like the sweet metal breath again. It makes her throat tighten.

She stops outside her door, hand on the knob, and listens. The heater inside ticks, steady and soft, like a clock you don't want to hear.

Her phone buzzes again, a new message.

Tonight.

She stands there in the dark, hand on the door, listening to the heater breathe.
