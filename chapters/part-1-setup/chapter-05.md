# Chapter 05: The Air That Wants You Back

Mara wakes to her own name, whispered, and for a moment she thinks the heater is learning to speak.

Her eyes open to a blur of gray light and the wet breath of morning. The window is shut again. The water bottle she wedged against it has rolled onto the floor, a clear plastic witness. The heater is still on, its flame a soft, steady blue. The room is warm enough that her skin is damp under the blankets. Her mouth tastes like she slept with a coin tucked in her cheek.

She sits up too fast and the room tilts. It is not a spin. It is a lag, like her brain is a video buffering in the wrong light. She presses her palm to the wall and waits for the pixelation to clear. The air feels thick, as if the room has been filled with something other than air. She looks at the window again and feels a flash of resentment, like it closed itself out of spite.

The whisper happens again, but this time she realizes it is only her phone vibrating against the nightstand. A text from Hannah, 8:03 a.m.: "You awake?" A second text, 8:05: "I made coffee. Come prove you are alive." Mara exhales, not quite a laugh, and types back, "Alive, mostly." Her fingers move slow, as if they are wearing mittens.

She pushes the window open. It resists, then gives. Cold, wet air floods in. The relief is immediate and then fades, like a painkiller that works for one minute too short. She turns the heater off. The flame winks out. The ticking stops. The room loses its heartbeat.

She sits on the edge of the bed and waits for the headache to subside. It does not. It sits behind her eyes like a dull light. She takes a sip of water. It tastes like plastic and something faintly metallic. She is not hungry, but her stomach is sour with emptiness, so she dresses anyway and pulls the extra blanket around her shoulders like a shawl.

In the hallway, the air is cooler than yesterday, which should be comforting but isn't. The walls feel damp under her palm. She notices a new strip of tape over a vent above her door, shiny and unblemished. The old tape has been removed or covered. The effect is like a scar that someone tried to erase and only made brighter.

She walks to the common room, one hand on the rail. The steps feel taller than yesterday. The smell of coffee reaches her before the room does, bitter and burned. It makes her salivate and gag at the same time.

Hannah is at the table with a mug and a plate of toast. She looks up as Mara enters, relief flickering across her face and then smoothing into a smile. "Look at you," she says. "Vertical." She slides the coffee over.

Mara wraps her hands around the mug. The heat feels good in her fingers. "I keep doing that," she says. "Waking up. It's very rude of me."

Hannah snorts. "Stop trying to die in my vicinity. It makes me look negligent." She peers at Mara's face. "You look less gray. Still not great."

"I feel like I slept inside a wool sock," Mara says. She sips the coffee. It tastes like smoke and sugar and makes her head throb. She doesn't put it down.

At the long table, the German guys are arguing about buses. Luis is eating a banana with the seriousness of a man who believes in electrolytes. The shaved-head guy with the compass tattoo is slumped in a chair, a hand pressed to his temple. His skin has a faint pink flush, like a sunburn in the wrong place.

"You sick too?" Mara asks, because the words are out before she can stop them.

He looks up. His eyes are glassy. "Headache," he says. "And..." He gestures vaguely, a wave that covers nausea and dizziness and everything else. "Maybe the beer. Maybe the air. Quito is funny." He smiles without humor.

"Altitude," Mara says, because that is the word everyone uses. It feels like a password.

He nods like a man who has already decided what he is going to ignore.

A staff member with a cart of towels passes by. The cart rattles. The receptionist is behind him, carrying a roll of tape. He sees Mara and pauses. "Room okay?" he asks, as if he is checking on a broken lamp.

"The window keeps closing," she says. She keeps her voice neutral.

"Wind," he says, and shrugs. "You put something heavier. Stool." He gestures toward the chair in her room.

"Is the heater safe?" she asks. The question is blunt, which makes her feel rude, which makes her ask it anyway.

The receptionist looks at her as if she asked whether gravity is safe. "It works," he says. "We use for years." He lifts the roll of tape. "Maintenance make sure." He smiles. It is not reassuring.

Hannah leans in when he walks away. "That is the least convincing man I have ever met," she says.

"He is consistent," Mara says. She tries to smile. It comes out weak.

Hannah sips her tea. "We should get you out today. Fresh air. Museum. Ride a bus to the middle of nowhere. Something." She pauses. "Also, I am not letting you nap in that room all day."

Mara thinks of the heater. Of the warm pull of the bed. Of the window that slides shut like it is ashamed of the outside. She thinks of the cold in her bones. "Okay," she says. "Get me out."

She eats her toast, which tastes like cardboard soaked in jam. The sweetness is too sweet. She eats it anyway.

---

By late morning, the sun has burned a clean hole in the clouds. The city looks almost cheerful. The air outside is thin and sharp and it stings Mara's lungs in a way that feels honest. It is the kind of discomfort she can handle.

They take the bus to the Teleferico, the cable car that climbs the side of Pichincha. The line is full of tourists with puffed jackets and selfie sticks. Hannah buys the tickets, because she is the competent one today. The cashier stamps their wrists with blue ink that says they have been counted.

The gondola is a glass box suspended over the city. It smells like rubber and excited sweat. Mara sits by the window and watches Quito fall away in stacked layers of roofs and streets. The higher they go, the smaller the hostel becomes, a speck of white and peeling paint in a grid of buildings. She should feel exhilarated. She mostly feels relieved to be out of the room.

Hannah leans close. "How do you feel up here?" she asks.

Mara takes a breath. The air is thinner than she is used to, but it feels clean. It doesn't taste like pennies. "Better," she says. "Like my brain has a little more room."

"Good." Hannah watches the mountains glide toward them like large, slow animals. "If you faint, try to land on someone rich."

Mara laughs. It is the first time today the laugh feels real.

At the top, the wind is cold and relentless. Mara's eyes water. She pulls her hoodie tight and stands at the overlook, letting the air shove her hair across her face. It smells like wet grass and stone. She breathes deep and it hurts in the right way.

A vendor sells coca tea and empanadas. The steam from the tea fogs the air. Mara buys a cup and wraps her hands around it. The tea tastes like grass and bitterness and placebo. She doesn't care. She feels almost human.

They walk the trail along the ridge. The ground is soft and damp, a sponge of grass. The city is a sheet of gray below them. Mara's legs feel heavy, but her head is clearer. The relief is enough to make her angry. She doesn't like how quickly her body tells her what it needs when she is listening, and how much she ignores it when she isn't.

A couple passes them, an older backpacker type with a wide hat and a hiking stick. He nods at Mara as they pass. "Altitude got you?" he asks, like it's a greeting.

"Maybe," Mara says.

He chuckles. "I thought altitude was killing me in Cusco. Turns out it was carbon monoxide. Old heater in a hostel. Woke up puking and seeing stars." He taps his temple. "Hospital put me on oxygen. The doctor said another hour and I would have been a story." He shrugs. "Maybe I still am."

Mara feels her stomach dip. She tries to keep her face neutral. "How did you know?"

"I passed out," he says, as if it were a punchline. "And my roommate had a detector. Tiny thing he bought online for fifteen bucks. It screamed at two in the morning. We thought it was a prank. It wasn't." He adjusts his hat. "You sleeping with a heater?"

Mara laughs too fast. "No. I mean, sometimes. It's cold." The words fall out without a plan.

"Open your window," he says, a casual, paternal command. "And if you feel sick indoors and fine outdoors, it isn't the mountain. It's your room."

He walks on. Hannah watches him go. "That seems... relevant," she says.

"Everything seems relevant lately," Mara says.

They continue along the trail. Mara's breath is steady. The wind dries her eyes. She tries to let the moment be simple: mountains, cold, tea, a friend who isn't a friend but is. But the man's story sits in her chest like a pebble. The idea of a tiny machine screaming in the dark seems both absurd and reasonable. The idea of waking up because a plastic box saved her life seems almost romantic. The idea of not waking up at all is less so.

On the ride down, Mara takes out her phone and records a quick story. She holds the camera to catch the city in the background. "Pro tip," she says, smiling into the lens. "Take the cable car. The air is worth it." She almost adds a line about heaters, about safety. She deletes it in her head. She posts the story anyway. It feels dishonest. It also feels necessary.

Back at the hostel, the afternoon light is slanted and thin. The courtyard is damp and empty. A cleaner is mopping the tiles with a bucket that smells like lemon and bleach. The smell makes Mara's stomach twist. She goes upstairs to get her charger and pauses at the top step, because the hallway feels warm again, a humid blanket. The maintenance guy is back, crouched by another vent, the tape in his hand. He nods without looking at her. She looks at the tape and sees how it clings, how it seals, how it closes.

She opens her door. The room is cool, because the heater is off, but the air is stale. It smells like the blanket and her damp clothes. She grabs her charger and a pair of socks, then stops. The heater sits in the corner, silent and squatting. The warning sticker is beginning to curl at the edges. She runs her finger along it and feels the paper flake. She opens the translation app anyway, because she wants to see the words again. DO NOT OPERATE IN CLOSED ROOMS. RISK OF POISONING. The words are plain and bored.

She sees the note from reception on the desk, the one about security and windows. She crumples it in her hand until it makes a small ball. She doesn't throw it away. She puts it in her pocket like a talisman of bad advice.

When she goes downstairs, Hannah is at the table with a map. "I found a hardware store nearby," she says. "We can check for a detector."

"Do you think they will have one?" Mara asks.

"No," Hannah says. "But if we try, we can at least say we tried."

Mara nods. She feels grateful and annoyed at the same time. She doesn't want to be a problem, but she also doesn't want to be a corpse. She follows Hannah out into the street.

The hardware store is a narrow place with shelves of nails and pipes and locks. A fan hums overhead, pushing warm air down. The man behind the counter has a mustache and a radio. He looks up as they enter and says something in Spanish. Hannah tries in her own Spanish, then switches to English, then back. It is a dance of misunderstanding.

"Detector," Hannah says, making a box with her hands and pretending to press a button.

The man frowns, then shakes his head. He points at smoke detectors on the wall, cheap plastic discs in dusty boxes. "Humo," he says. Smoke.

"Carbon monoxide," Hannah says. She pronounces it slowly, the way you pronounce a word you are not sure the world shares.

He shrugs. "No," he says. "Solo humo." Only smoke. He gestures toward a shelf of battery-operated fans. "Ventilador," he says. He points at the fans, then at the ceiling, then at the door, as if to suggest the solution is to move air around and hope for the best.

Mara buys a small fan on impulse. It is cheap and light and comes in a box that says COOL AIR in bright letters. The irony makes her laugh and then not laugh. She pays in cash and carries it back like a pet she isn't sure she wants.

"We have a plan now," Hannah says, trying to make it sound like a victory.

"Our plan is a fan and an open window," Mara says.

"Better than a shrug," Hannah says.

---

By evening, the hostel is humming again. The bar crawl crowd is assembling in the common room. Someone is pre-gaming with cheap beer. The air smells like hops and sweat. Mara sits on the couch with the fan on her lap, still in its box. It feels ridiculous. It also feels like something she can control.

She unboxes it and plugs it in. The fan hums to life, the blades a blur. It pushes air across her face. The air is not fresh, but it moves, and that feels like relief. She lets it blow for a few minutes, then turns it off. The hostel's outlets are precious. She doesn't want to be the person who hogs them.

Hannah appears with a bowl of popcorn someone made in the kitchen. "Are you coming out tonight?" she asks.

"Probably not," Mara says. "I need to edit. And I am still...		" She gestures vaguely at her head.

"Okay," Hannah says. She looks at Mara for a long second. "Do you want to sleep in the dorm? I can tell the girls to make room."

Mara imagines the dorm: the bunks, the smell of feet, the snoring. She imagines her equipment, her laptop, her chargers, her life, all in her private room. She imagines being asked why she is suddenly in the dorm and how she would explain without sounding dramatic. She wants the room and she doesn't. She wants to be safe and she wants to be in control. The two things are in a quiet fight.

"I'll stay in my room," she says. She hates that she says it.

Hannah nods. "Text me in the morning. And, seriously, open the window."

"I will," Mara says. She means it and doesn't.

She goes upstairs. The hallway is warm again, a slow, low heat that makes the air feel used. The heaters are on in the corridor, their small flames making a soft ticking. The taped vents look like bandages on a body that won't stop bleeding. She reaches her door and pauses. The fan is light in her hand. She feels like she is bringing a toy to a fight.

Inside, the room is cold. The window is shut. She opens it immediately, shoving it until it groans, and props the stool against it as a heavier wedge. She looks at the water bottle on the floor, still there from the morning. She doesn't move it.

She sets the fan on the desk and plugs it in. The outlet sparks lightly and the fan hums. She aims it toward the window, as if to push bad air out and good air in. It is probably not how air works. It makes her feel better anyway.

She considers leaving the heater off and relying on the blankets. The room is damp. The cold is the kind that gets into her joints. She pulls on an extra sweater. She sits on the bed and tries to edit footage on her laptop, but the screen makes her eyes ache. The fan hums beside her, a small, steady sound.

A knock at the door makes her jump. She opens it to find the shaved-head guy with the compass tattoo standing in the hallway, his face pale. "Hey," he says. "Do you have painkillers?"

"Yeah," she says. She grabs a bottle from her bag and hands it to him. His fingers are cold. He smiles a thank you.

"You okay?" she asks, because now she is the one asking.

He rubs his temple. "Head is killing me. I went downstairs and they said altitude. Always altitude." He rolls his eyes. "My room smells like gas. I told them. They shrugged. So I opened the window and froze. It's like you pick your poison."

Mara feels a chill that has nothing to do with the room. "What room are you in?"

"Seven." He holds up the bottle. "Thanks. I'll bring it back." He walks away down the warm hallway, his shoulders hunched.

Mara stands in her doorway for a moment, the fan humming behind her, the heater off, the window open. The hallway smells faintly sweet. She can almost taste it. She closes the door and turns the fan up to the highest setting. The air in the room stirs, a weak imitation of wind.

She tries to work, but her focus slides off the screen. She checks her phone instead. There is a new message from the blank account. "You bought a fan. Smart. But it does not fix poison." No punctuation, no hello. The message makes her skin crawl. She doesn't know how whoever it is knows about the fan. She tells herself it is a guess. It doesn't feel like a guess.

She considers replying. She considers deleting. She does neither. She turns the phone face down and stares at the wall. The wall has a faint stain above the heater vent, a smoky crescent that was not there on the first day. She wonders how long it has been there and why she is only seeing it now.

She turns the heater on. The flame catches with a soft whoosh. The fan blows, mixing the warm air. The smell arrives anyway, faint and sweet. She opens the window another inch. The stool holds it in place. The fan hums louder, a small mechanical reassurance.

She makes a small video on her phone, a time-lapse of the rain starting again outside the window. She posts it with a caption about storms and cozy nights. She does not mention heaters. She does not mention poison. She adds a little cloud emoji. People will like it. They will think she is safe.

She showers, letting the hot water steam her head clear. The bathroom mirror fogs. She writes NO HEATER in the fog with her finger and then wipes it away. She doesn't know why she does it. It is not a vow. It is just a moment.

Back in her room, she gets under the blankets with the fan still running, the heater on low. The combination makes the room feel like a warm breeze, which is almost pleasant. She sets her alarm. She opens her phone to Hannah's thread and types, "Window open. Fan on. Heater low. I will live." She stares at the message and deletes it. She doesn't want to be dramatic. She doesn't want to be a burden. She doesn't want to admit that she is scared.

She puts the phone down and turns off the light. The fan hums, the heater ticks. The window is open a hand's width, the stool braced. The air feels like a compromise between comfort and caution.

She is almost asleep when she hears a soft thud in the hallway, followed by a muffled voice. She sits up. Another thud. The sound of someone being helped, a chair scraping, a low, worried murmur. She gets out of bed and opens the door a crack.

In the hallway, the compass-tattoo guy is slumped against the wall, the receptionist and the cleaner supporting him. His face is pale and sweaty. His eyes are half-closed. The receptionist is speaking in low Spanish, annoyed and urgent. The cleaner is saying something else, softer, a prayer or a complaint. The air around them smells sweet and hot.

Mara grips the doorframe. "What happened?" she asks.

The receptionist glances at her. "He faint," he says. "Altitude." He says it like a stamp he puts on everything, like a label that makes it someone else's problem.

"He said his room smelled like gas," Mara says.

The receptionist's jaw tightens. "We open his window," he says. "He stay downstairs now." He looks at her. "You go sleep. Open your window."

She nods because there is nothing else she can do. She steps back into her room and closes the door, the sound soft and final. Her heart is beating faster than it should. She looks at the heater. She looks at the fan. She looks at the open window and the stool braced against it.

She turns the heater off. The room drops two degrees in ten seconds. The cold crawls in like it has been waiting.

She sits on the bed and stares at the dark. She listens to the fan, now the only sound in the room, pushing air through a space she is not sure is safe. She thinks about the compass guy on the floor. She thinks about the word altitude, and how easy it is to use as a blanket over anything you don't want to name.

She pulls the blankets up and shivers. She tells herself she can be cold for one night. She tells herself she can do it. She repeats it until the words become a rhythm.

In the hallway, a door closes. Footsteps fade. The hostel settles into its night sounds: a distant laugh, a toilet flushing, the soft sigh of pipes. Mara closes her eyes and tries to sleep in the cold.

At some point, she wakes. The fan has stopped. The room is quiet, too quiet. She reaches for her phone to check the time, but her arm feels heavy, as if the blankets are made of sand. She blinks, confused. The window is still open. The stool still holds it. The heater is off. The air should be fine.

Her head is thick again, heavier than it should be. The taste of pennies is back. She tries to sit up and her body resists, as if the mattress has hands. She thinks about the compass guy. She thinks about the man on the mountain who said you feel sick inside and fine outside. She thinks about the oxygen can on her nightstand, unopened, like a joke.

She reaches for it anyway. Her fingers fumble. The can slips and rolls onto the floor, landing with a dull, metallic sound. The sound should be small. It echoes in her head.

She starts to sit up again, but the room tilts and the air feels thinner, not with altitude but with absence. She opens her mouth to call out, but only a thin sound comes out, a rasp. She swallows and tries again.

The doorhandle rattles once, then again, harder. Hannah's voice is on the other side, urgent and strained. "Mara? Open the door. Now."

Mara reaches for the handle, her fingers slow, her body heavy. The room seems to stretch, as if the door has moved farther away. The air feels thick, like water.

She gets one knee off the bed. The world goes gray at the edges.

Her hand closes around the handle.
