# Chapter 01: The Room With the View of Nothing

The room is the size of a shrug, and Mara tries not to take it personally.

She stands in the doorway with her backpack biting her shoulder, taking in the geometry of it: bed, desk, heater, window. The bed is a punished rectangle on a metal frame that squeaks like a confession. The desk is smaller than her carry-on suitcase. The window looks at the back of a laundry building, which looks at a retaining wall, which looks at nothing at all. If a view could apologize, this one would.

She laughs anyway, because she has learned to laugh when she should complain. It is a rehearsed posture, the kind that reads as graceful instead of petty. It is also a survival skill. The laugh comes out too loud in a room this small and ricochets off the chipped paint. It makes the air feel thicker.

In the corner, a wall-mounted gas heater squats like an old pet. Its body is painted the color of old teeth, with a little glass window for the flame. There is a laminated yellow warning sticker in Spanish and a small metal vent that runs up the wall into a patch of mismatched ceiling. Someone has taped the vent with aluminum tape that is peeling at the edges, a small silver mouth half open.

She is too tired to translate the warning. She is too tired to remember that she promised herself she would never stay in a place with gas. Not after the blog post. Not after the thread. Not after the annual "Safety While You Sleep" video where she wore a beanie and held a flashlight under her chin like she was auditioning for a campfire story.

It's Day One. It's an origin story. She is not supposed to start with a warning label.

Downstairs, check-in was a choreography of indifference. The clerk had stamped her passport with the bored efficiency of someone who has done the check-in dance for the bored. He slid the key across the counter and said, in accented English, "Room nine. No smoking. Don't move heater." Then he pointed at a sign about a city-wide water outage tonight and laughed as if it were a joke. The sign was in Spanish and English. The English was funny in the way machine translations are funny. "No water after 9 p.m. Please to be not mad." It could have been a warning about a bomb, and the font would have made it whimsical.

She drops her bag on the bed. The bed squeals. Her shoulders tense. She tells herself it is fine. It is all fine. The hostel is fine. She is fine. The checklist in her head is a running tally of content: unbox the room, first impressions, Quito day one, budget travel. Her life is a spreadsheet with an audience.

She reaches for the crooked framed print above the bed and straightens it. The print is a beach with palms and a waterline that looks too blue to be real. The frame is cheap and the nail is bent, and she presses it into place like a surgeon. It is her first act in a new space, her small claim on it. It feels like control.

Her knee bumps the heater. It clicks.

She looks down. The little glass window is soot-dark, and above it the vent disappears into the ceiling with the taped seam. She can see a line of black where the tape has peeled. The warning sticker looks official and tired. She fumbles for her phone and waves it over the sticker. The translation app swims for a moment, then delivers: "DO NOT COVER VENTS. TURN OFF WHEN SLEEPING." It adds an unnecessary skull emoji, like a teenager who wants credit for being serious.

"Don't move heater," the clerk had said. She doesn't plan to. It's bolted to the wall. The vents are not something she can cover even if she wants to. But she is also not planning to sleep with the heater on. She's from Minnesota. She knows cold. But this cold is wet, the kind that gets into your bones and sits on them like a sulky cat. The damp is a clingy date that won't take the hint.

She rubs her arms. She flips the heater switch, just to see if it works. The flame inside flickers. It looks like the heater is thinking about its life choices.

It catches, and she feels the room exhale warm air almost immediately. There is a faint smell, a hot-metal smell that makes her think of school hallways and winter mornings. It is comforting. It is dangerous in a boring way, the way most things are dangerous.

She leaves it on. Just while she unpacks.

Unpacking is not romantic. There are no silk dresses or travel journals. There are three T-shirts, two pairs of pants, a bag of electronics that looks like a snake pit. She is not the kind of traveler who floats. She is the kind who drags cords.

Her backpack spits out cables like spaghetti. She assembles them on the desk with the same methodical mania she uses for her videos: laptop, microphone, tiny tripod, rechargeable light ring. Her livelihood is in those cords. Her identity is in the little lens that makes her eyes look a shade brighter. She checks everything twice. The Wi-Fi password is written on the door in marker, and it doesn't work the first time, which means she has to go down to reception to ask, which means she has to be seen without being ready.

She is used to being ready.

In the hallway, a guy with a shaved head and a huge backpack winks at her and says something in Portuguese. He has a compass tattooed on his forearm and the particular bounce of someone who has not yet been humbled by a bus delay. She smiles politely and pretends she understood. She has been in thirty-eight hostels in fifteen countries. This has happened enough to be a standard script.

The reception desk is empty. She waits a moment. There is a bell. She considers the bell. She doesn't ring the bell. Instead, she reads the bulletin board, a collage of tour ads and warnings and handwritten notes in multiple languages. "Yoga on the roof at 7 a.m." "Beware of pickpockets in La Mariscal." "Don't trust the guy with the red hat." And then, in a corner, a faded notice with a drawing of a heater and an X through it. It says, in Spanish, "Do not place items on or near heaters. Do not sleep with heaters on." Someone has written a joke underneath in English: "Unless you want to be roasted." It has a little winking face.

When the clerk returns, he is chewing. He gives her the Wi-Fi password without looking at her. It is a string of numbers and a hashtag. She thanks him. He nods. The exchange is so normal she almost misses it.

Back in her room, the heater has made the air soft. The damp has backed down. The small room feels less like a coffin and more like a warm pocket. Mara has a ritual for new places. It is less spiritual and more algorithmic. It begins with a ten-second story for her followers, something light and travel-y, something that makes them think she is the kind of person who wakes up at dawn to drink coffee by the ocean. She is not. She wakes up at noon and drinks coffee by her laptop.

She props her phone against her backpack and records a quick clip. "Quito, Day One," she whispers, because she's trying to be respectful, and because she is alone and whispering feels theatrical. She pans the camera around the room, catching the heater and the beach print. She makes a face. "Tiny room, big adventures. Let's go." She adds a cheeky sticker when she posts it. She chooses the one that says "cozy" with a little sweat drop.

Within minutes, someone comments, "Stay safe! Quito is sketchy." Another writes, "OMG heater, don't die lol." She taps a heart on both and keeps moving.

The common room downstairs is full of post-flight frenzy: bags half-unpacked, shoes off, hair still with airplane kink. It is a scene designed to make you think everyone is a protagonist. The couches are leather-like and cracked. The walls are covered in flags. An enormous world map has pins stuck into it like a geography rash. People are already arguing over where to eat dinner, a debate that will take longer than dinner.

Mara sits at the edge of it with a coffee that tastes like ash and sugar. She is not a joiner, but she is a performer. She chooses a spot where she can be seen and makes sure her posture says open. This is the math of a hostel. You do not want to be alone unless you are paid to be alone, and even then you should let people think you might change your mind.

A woman with a bob haircut and a hiking jacket sits across from her. She is reading a guidebook and making notes, which feels like a confident move. Mara envies her. The woman looks up.

"First time in Quito?" she asks.

"First time in Ecuador," Mara says. "I'm doing a few weeks. Maybe more." She makes it sound like a choice instead of a budget.

"Altitude got you yet?" the woman asks. She is British. Her tone is compassionate in the way people are compassionate when they have survived something and are waiting for you to succumb.

"Not yet," Mara says. She sips her coffee and pretends the slight tightness in her chest is just the coffee.

The woman's name is Hannah. She has been in the Andes for two months, doing volunteer work and hiking until her knees hate her. She asks what Mara does, and Mara gives the practiced answer: travel content, a small channel, a mix of guides and "real talk." She says "real talk" with finger quotes even though Hannah cannot see them. She doesn't mention that her real talk is mostly sponsored.

"Ah, influencer," Hannah says. She doesn't sound contemptuous. She sounds tired.

"Sure," Mara says, because she has learned not to fight the word.

Across the room, a group at the big table plays cards. They are loud and German. They are losing with flair. A tall guy with a man bun and a sunburn drops a card and curses in four languages. The hostel hums with the end-of-day energy of people who have not yet been disappointed by their day.

Mara likes the common room. It is messy and alive. It is an anti-chamber, a place where everyone's story is temporarily the same: key, bed, backpack, coffee. She is a professional consumer of places, and these small moments are her only real pleasure. But she can feel the undertow of being new, of being unmoored. It makes her talk more than she should.

"I booked a private room," she tells Hannah, as if confessing. "I needed to, uh, get some work done." She says the word work like it is a charm that wards off judgment.

"No shame," Hannah says. "Shared rooms are the real horror." She gestures toward the staircase. "Plus, I've heard the heaters in some of the dorms are weird. Like, they smell. The ones upstairs are okay." She says it like an aside, but it lands in Mara like a pebble.

"Mine seems fine," Mara says too quickly. It's a lie and a defense. It has smelled. She shrugs. "Old building. Adds charm."

Hannah smiles. "Adds carbon," she says, and then she smiles again so Mara knows she is joking.

Mara laughs. Hannah laughs. Mara does not say that the joke settles in her chest like a stone.

At dinner, she goes out with a small group: Hannah, the Portuguese guy whose name turns out to be Luis, and a Swedish couple on a "digital detox" who have brought three cameras. They eat in a place with red walls and candles and a menu translated into English with a sense of adventure. The food is good, mostly because she is hungry. The laughter is easy, mostly because she is tired. They swap travel stories like trading cards. Mara tells the one about the monkey in Laos that stole her passport and had to be bribed with crackers. It's a lie but it's a good lie.

When she gets back to the hostel, the water has been turned off. The bathroom sinks are empty and the toilet looks at her with blank eyes. Someone has taped a note to the mirror: "SAVE YOUR FLUSHES." There is a bucket in the corner full of cloudy water. She splashes her face and feels the grit of it. It smells like metal.

She climbs to her floor. The hallway is warmer now, the kind of warm that doesn't belong. She passes another yellow warning sticker near the stairwell. It says something about ventilation. Someone has slapped a cartoon skull over the important part. It is funny. It is not funny.

Her room has cooled down since she left. The damp has returned. She stands in the doorway for a moment and listens. She can hear the city outside: a dog bark, a car honk, distant music, the wet hiss of tires on wet streets. Quito is alive and indifferent. The hostel is alive and threadbare. She is alive and pretending this is an escape instead of what she can afford.

She flips the heater on again.

The flame catches, brighter this time. The vent makes a gentle ticking sound as it heats. The smell is back, the hot-metal smell, and beneath it something faintly sweet, like burnt sugar. She tells herself it's dust burning off. She tells herself it is normal. She tells herself a hundred small things because the alternative is to admit she is alone in a strange city at altitude in a tiny room with a gas heater and a warning label, and she does not have the energy to be that responsible.

---

Her nighttime routine takes ten minutes. She brushes her teeth with bottled water because the note said so. She takes off her socks and hangs them over the chair. She sets her phone alarm for 7 a.m. so she can go on the rooftop yoga, which she will not actually do. She scrolls her feed. She watches other people live the version of travel she is supposed to be living. She likes a picture of a cliffside hotel in Santorini and thinks about how the cliff looks like a tooth.

A message comes in from her mom: "Text me when you get in. Love you." Mara texts her a photo of the hostel courtyard, taken earlier in daylight. It has string lights and a hammock and looks charming in the filtered way of daylight. She does not mention the heater. She does not mention the water. She does not mention that the hallway smells like someone is roasting coffee but there is no coffee.

The heater makes the room cozy. It makes her eyelids heavy. She slips under the thin blanket. The blanket smells like bleach and someone else's laundry. She can feel the heat on her cheeks. It is too much and not enough at the same time. She gets up and opens the window. It squeals like a complaint. Cool, damp air rushes in. The heater kicks harder in response, as if offended.

She pulls the curtain half closed. The laundry building outside is a brick wall with a single light that flickers. The wall sweats. The window latch doesn't quite catch, and she has to push it twice. When it does close, the air changes. The room goes still. The heater's tick-tick-tick grows louder. It is the only thing making noise now. It is a heartbeat.

She should turn it off. She is aware of the thought. She ignores it, which is something she is good at. She tells herself it will be fine. She tells herself she will wake up when it gets too warm. She tells herself that if there was danger, there would be a detector on the wall, some little white box with a green light. There is not.

She does not think about why there is not.

As she drifts, she rehearses tomorrow's content. She needs to film a "Quito on a Budget" video. She needs to find a market and a street food vendor and a view. She needs to find a story to tell that is not just about sitting in a room with a heater and a smartphone. She needs to be likable. She needs to be alive.

The last thought is a dull thud she pushes aside. She is too tired to hold it. Sleep takes her like a wave.

In her dream, she is underwater. It is not a nightmare. It is a slow, painless drift. The water is warm. Her limbs are heavy. Somewhere above her, a light flickers. She thinks she should swim up, but her body feels filled with sand. She looks at her hands and they are pink and drifting like petals. She opens her mouth and water comes in and it tastes like pennies.

She wakes to the sound of the heater clicking off. Her room is dark. She blinks. Her head hurts. It is a small headache at first, a tight band around her temples. She rolls over and glances at her phone. 3:12 a.m. The room feels oddly stuffy, like a humid bathroom after a shower. She takes a breath. It feels like breathing through cloth.

She sits up and the movement makes her dizzy. The heater has cycled off and the ticking has stopped. There is a faint sweet smell, like burnt caramel. Her mouth tastes metallic, like she licked a battery. She rubs her face. Her skin is damp. Not hot, exactly, just damp. She swings her legs over the side of the bed and puts her feet on the cold tile.

The window is closed. She remembers closing it. She wonders why. She opens it now and the cool air rushes in and she gasps, as if she has been holding her breath. The relief is immediate and then gone. The headache is worse. She presses her fingers to her forehead and curses softly.

This is altitude, she tells herself. This is jet lag. This is her being dramatic. She gets up and goes to the bathroom, carrying her phone as a light. The hallway is empty and dim. The hostel is a ship at night, creaking in the dark. The bathroom smells like disinfectant and something sour. She splashes water on her face, but the tap hisses and nothing comes out. Right. Water outage. She uses bottled water again, a small indignity to add to the list.

When she gets back to her room, the heater clicks on again. It sighs into life with a flicker of blue flame. She stands in the doorway, feeling the warm air push toward her. The moment feels eerie. The heater is a living thing. It wants something. She cannot tell what.

Her phone buzzes. A notification. Someone has commented on her story. "Cozy! Turn on heater and sleep well :)" She snorts. She types back, "Already on lol," and adds a little fire emoji. She crawls back into bed.

Lying down makes the dizziness worse. The room spins slightly. She closes her eyes. She focuses on her breathing. The air feels thin, as if someone has taken a small percentage of it away. She tells herself that is literally what altitude is. She tells herself to stop being dramatic.

When she wakes again, her mouth is dry and her head feels like it has been tightened with a wrench. The digital clock on her phone says 6:38 a.m. Outside, the city is waking, and she can hear the low rumble of buses and the high chatter of birds. She should feel rested. She does not.

She sits up, and the movement makes her nauseous. She swallows it. She swings her legs down. The floor feels unsteady. She puts a hand on the wall. The paint is cold. Her fingers leave a damp print.

The heater is still on.

It is an innocent statement. It should not carry weight. It does. The flame is visible through the little glass window, steady and blue. She stares at it. The air is warm. Too warm. She feels sweat at the base of her neck.

She has a choice. She can turn it off and open the window and make coffee and go do yoga and be a person who makes good choices. Or she can pull the blanket over her head and sleep a little more and hope the headache goes away.

She thinks about the yoga. She thinks about how she doesn't want to be seen in the state she's in, with her hair and her dull eyes. She thinks about how she is not a morning person and how she has already paid for this room and how no one will know if she stays in bed.

She pulls the blanket up to her chin.

It smells like bleach. She tells herself it smells clean. She closes her eyes. The heater hums. The room is warm. The air is thick. The world narrows to the sound of her own breath.

It is not her breath that wakes her. It is her phone, vibrating under her pillow. A text from Hannah: "You alive? Yoga in 20. Don't die in there lol." Mara smirks. She types back, "Alive. Maybe," and adds a skull emoji because that is what people do instead of telling the truth.

Her headache is now a full, heavy thing, like a helmet. She sits up and the room lurches. She puts her head between her knees. She can smell the heater now, that faint sweet smell, the burnt sugar that is not sugar. It makes her think of her childhood, of toasted marshmallows over a gas stove. It makes her think of her dad turning off the pilot light and saying, "Don't mess with gas." It makes her think of a warning label she did not read.

She stands and goes to the window. She pushes it open. It groans. The air outside is cold and wet. It hits her face like a slap, and she inhales greedily, as if she has been underwater. The room exhales. The heater continues to burn, steady and blue, unbothered.

"Okay," she says to the heater, out loud, because there is no one else. "Okay, fine." She reaches down and flips the switch off. The flame dies. The ticking stops. The room goes quiet.

For a moment, she feels better. The relief is small and maybe imagined. She stands at the window and breathes, and the city breathes with her. The laundry building's light flickers. Somewhere, someone laughs.

She looks at the heater's warning sticker and, for the first time, translates it fully. The app delivers a cold, blunt line: "Never operate in a closed room. Risk of poisoning."

Her stomach turns. She swallows. She tells herself she is overreacting. She tells herself she is fine. She tells herself that if she were poisoned, she would be dead. She tells herself that poison is a story that happens to other people, in other rooms, in other books.

She decides to leave the window open. She decides to go downstairs and get coffee and find Hannah and do yoga and laugh at herself for being paranoid.

She steps away from the window. The room tilts. She grabs the chair. Her hand slips on the vinyl. A sudden, irrational urge tells her to lie down. It is a deep, bone-level pull, like gravity has doubled. It tells her to go back to bed, to rest, to close her eyes. It is the most persuasive thought she has had all week.

She shakes her head and takes a step. The world shimmers. She blinks. Her vision clears. She takes another step, and her foot catches on the edge of her backpack. She stumbles and laughs, a short, sharp laugh that surprises her with how thin it sounds.

"Get it together," she mutters to herself.

She bends to pick up the backpack, and the movement sends a spike of nausea through her. She stands up too fast. The room spins. The window seems suddenly far away. The floor is not where she expects it to be. She grips the edge of the bed and closes her eyes until the spinning stops. When she opens them, the heater is still there, a dead hunk of metal, and the warning sticker shines in the early light.

Her phone buzzes again. Another text from Hannah: "I'm headed to the roof. If you don't come, I'll steal your coffee." A smiley face follows. It feels like a lifeline. Mara types back, "On my way." The lie tastes bitter.

She grabs her hoodie and pulls it on. The fabric smells like the street, like travel. She takes one more breath of cold air at the window. She tries to keep it in. She tries to carry it with her like a talisman.

When she opens the door to the hallway, she is hit with a wall of warmth. The hallway is too warm for morning. It smells like someone is making toast. It smells like the heater. The floor tilts again. She puts her hand on the wall. The wall is warm too.

Her stomach flips. She swallows it down. She takes a step into the hallway and the world narrows, the edges of her vision dimming as if someone is turning down the lights. She blinks hard. She is not passing out. She is fine. She is always fine. She has a video to film. She has a life to curate.

The world narrows again. The edges go gray. She reaches back into the room for balance and her hand grabs the doorframe. Her fingers tremble. The heater is off. The window is open. The warning is translated. The thought of danger is now real enough to be named.

She takes one more step into the hallway, and her foot misses the floor by a centimeter. The ground rises up to meet her.

As she falls, she thinks, absurdly, of her followers. Of the comments that will come if she doesn't post in the morning. Of the algorithm. Of the joke about dying in a hostel. Of how funny it isn't.

Then her cheek hits the tile, and the world goes dark.
