# Chapter 02: Dead Air

Mara wakes to the taste of pennies and the feeling that the floor is trying to pull her through it.

The hallway tiles are cold against her cheek. The light above her flickers like a nervous eyelid. Someone is saying her name, and for a second she thinks it's her mother, which would mean she is home, which would mean she can stop pretending this is an adventure. The voice says it again, sharper. Her name is a rubber band snapping back into place.

"Hey. Hey. You good?" A face swims into focus. Hannah's. Above her, the bob haircut and the hiking jacket, the concerned British frown.

Mara tries to nod and the movement makes her nauseous. The hallway is a narrow tunnel, warm and too bright. She is aware of the smell now, the sweet, burnt sugar smell that lingers in her hair, and something else underneath, metallic and sharp like a coin held on the tongue. Her head feels like it's packed with cotton.

"I think I... tripped," she says, and even she hears how thin it sounds.

A man with a hostel polo shirt appears, the same bored receptionist from last night now blinking into the morning. He holds a paper cup of coffee as if it is part of his uniform. He looks at her like she is a pothole in his shift. "No blood," he says. "You need help?"

"I'm fine," Mara says automatically. She tries to sit up. The hallway tilts. She sits back down. "Altitude, I think. Just... stood up too fast." She smiles, as if her body isn't a television with bad reception.

Hannah kneels beside her and puts a hand on her shoulder, which is a comfort and a public service. "Your room?" she asks.

"Nine," Mara says. She doesn't want to say more. She doesn't want to say heater or window or warning sticker or dream about drowning. She doesn't want to be the dramatic American.

The receptionist glances down the hall. "You got heater on?" he asks. His tone is casual, like asking if she left the light on.

"No," she lies. She doesn't know why, except that it feels easier than getting into it. The heater is off now, she thinks. She turned it off. The flame is dead. The memory is fuzzy.

He shrugs. "Maybe eat. Drink water. It's morning." He takes a sip of his coffee. It smells like ash and sugar. The hallway smells like ash too, but in a different register.

Hannah hooks an arm around Mara's shoulders and helps her stand. Mara's knees feel too loose. She tries not to lean too hard. She is supposed to be the capable one.

"Come on," Hannah says. "Let's get you downstairs. We can do dramatic fainting in a better-lit space." She says it with a smile, and Mara laughs weakly. The laugh makes her temples throb.

They walk the hallway slowly. Every step is a negotiation. The heat is still too much, a soft blanket that suffocates instead of comforts. She notices, for the first time, a line of metal pipe running along the ceiling, disappearing into the plaster like a swallowed vein. There is a dark stain around one joint, a ring like a bruise.

At the top of the stairs, the wall-mounted heater outside the dorms clicks on and she flinches. The sound is small and ordinary. It fills the space anyway.

"You're sure you don't want a doctor?" Hannah asks when they're halfway down.

Mara shakes her head. "It's altitude. I get this every time. I just... got up too fast." She says it like she is reciting a line. She has said it before, in other cities, for other symptoms. It has always been true enough.

In the common room, the morning looks like a hungover aquarium. People drift through in socks, hair upright, carrying mugs that smell like the dark roast from the staff kitchen. The radio plays a tinny pop song in Spanish. The light is gray and polite, filtered through the courtyard's string lights.

Hannah sits her on the cracked leather couch and hands her a cup of tea. It tastes like hot water and obligation. Mara wraps her hands around it, letting the heat sink into her palms. Her fingers are cold despite the warm air.

"You scared me," Hannah says, and Mara hears the sincerity underneath the joking. "You went down like a sack of rice."

"Sorry for the dramatic entrance," Mara says. She smiles. She is good at that. "I didn't even get to vlog it."

"That's when you know you're really sick," Hannah says. "No content."

Mara sips the tea. It does nothing. Her head is still a tight band. Her stomach is a small, sour stone. She tells herself that coffee will fix it, that breakfast will fix it, that doing the right things will make her feel right. It is always a story about control.

The receptionist passes by with the same coffee cup. He glances at Mara and lifts his chin, as if acknowledging a brief inconvenience. "You need anything, ask reception," he says. "Doctor is far. Hospital is..." He trails off and makes a vague gesture that could mean far or expensive or not worth it. "Better to eat."

"What's with the heat in the hall?" a German guy asks him from the table, rubbing his eyes. "It's like a sauna upstairs."

The receptionist shrugs. "Old building. Cold nights. Heaters run."

"But it's already hot," the guy says. He wears a soccer jersey and the kind of shorts that look like he woke up in them.

"It's Quito," the receptionist says. "Weather changes."

He walks away before anyone can argue. The radio keeps playing. The morning keeps happening. The hostel keeps being a hostel, indifferent to a girl who fell in the hallway.

Mara stares at the string lights, watching them hum. She feels oddly detached, as if she's watching herself from above. She hates the sensation. She wants her body to feel like hers again.

She texts her mother: "All good. Had a little dizzy moment. Altitude is weird." She adds a laughing emoji to make it lighter. Her mother replies with a heart and the kind of advice that is the same in every language: drink water, rest, be careful. Mara promises. She will not.

She eats a piece of toast with jam that tastes like sugar and nothing. She drinks coffee that tastes like smoke and old beans. The caffeine is a small electric itch in her veins. It doesn't fix the headache. It shifts it to a different part of her head, like furniture moved around in a room to make it feel new.

Hannah slides into the seat next to her. "We can skip yoga," she says. "I can stay in and pretend to stretch if you want."

Mara looks toward the staircase where the morning light is starting to creep. The thought of the roof, of the cold air, of the view, feels like it might scrape the fog off her brain. It also feels exhausting. She wants to be the kind of person who says yes to sunrise yoga. She wants to be the kind of person who isn't on a couch with a headache in a hostel in Ecuador.

"I'll try," she says. "Maybe it'll help."

They climb the stairs. Each step is a small test. The hallway is still too warm. The heaters are too loud for such small machines. As they pass Mara's room, she glances at the door. It sits closed and innocent, the number 9 slightly crooked. The window inside is open, she thinks. The heater is off. The air should be fresh. She repeats it like a mantra.

On the roof, the city opens itself like a book. Quito is a jagged line of roofs and church domes, the mountains blue and patient behind it. The air is thin and wet and cold enough to make Mara's eyes water. It is also clean, and she inhales it like a starving person.

The yoga instructor is a sleepy Argentine with a tattoo of a fern. She says things like "let the mountain breathe through you" and "feel the sky pressing down" and Mara, who is usually allergic to the spiritual tourism of yoga, finds it comforting anyway. She folds into a forward bend and the blood rush makes her head throb. She comes out of it slowly, because she is not twenty anymore, despite her online persona.

Hannah watches her. "Still dizzy?"

"A little," Mara admits. Her voice sounds far away. She pulls her hoodie tighter. The cold air feels sharp, like it has edges.

"Altitude hits weird," Hannah says. "I passed out in La Paz once. Hit my head on a chair. Gave myself a dent and a story." She taps her forehead. "You're in good company."

Mara laughs. It is a small, real laugh. She wants to be in good company. She wants this to be a normal travel story, the kind she can tell in three sentences in a video: "Altitudes are no joke, guys. Drink water, take it slow." The kind that makes people think she is tough.

A guy unrolls his mat beside them and exhales loudly. He looks at Mara. "You okay?" he asks, casual, as if she is part of the morning's ambiance.

"Just the air," she says. "It's thinner than my bank account." It is a joke she has told before. It lands. He laughs.

The instructor leads them through a slow flow. Mara moves carefully, her limbs heavy. When she lifts her arms overhead, the sky is a milky white. A plane crawls across it like an insect. She can hear the city below, a low mutter of traffic and distant music. She can smell bread from somewhere, the bakery smell that makes her think of home and childhood and her mother's kitchen. For a moment, she feels better.

But as they lie in final rest, flat on their backs with eyes closed, Mara's mind drifts. The warm sun on her face is a balm. She feels the same pull to sleep that she felt in her room, a gravity that seems to increase without warning. She opens her eyes and sits up quickly, breaking the pose. The instructor glances at her, but doesn't say anything. The mat under her feels scratchy. Her throat feels dry.

When the session ends, she stands too fast and the roof wobbles. Hannah steadies her by the elbow. "Let's get you some food," she says. "Real food." They head down together, and Mara is grateful for the companionship and annoyed at the need for it.

---

By late morning, the hostel has filled with the smells of onions and damp laundry. The kitchen is small and busy. There is a whiteboard where someone has written "Pancakes @ 10" and drawn a smiley face. The smiley has been annotated with a frown by someone else. Mara makes eggs and burns them slightly because she forgets to watch the pan. The burnt edges taste like the heater smell. It makes her stomach turn.

She escapes to the courtyard, where the air is slightly better. The hammock is occupied by a guy who looks like he lives in it. He nods at her in greeting. She sits at a small table and opens her laptop. The Wi-Fi stutters. She posts a quick update to her followers: a photo of the roof view with a caption about altitude and gratitude. She filters it to make the sky bluer. She watches the likes tick in. The dopamine is small and mean, but it works.

A message pops up from an account she doesn't recognize: "Heaters in Quito kill. Be careful." The profile is blank, the name a string of numbers. Mara stares at it for a moment. She considers replying. She doesn't. She tells herself it is a troll, a horror fan, someone who thinks they're being funny. She blocks the account out of principle. It feels like a small act of control.

She closes her laptop and rubs her eyes. The headache has dulled but not left. It is a foggy roommate, still on the couch. She checks her room key and decides to go back upstairs to get her camera. She wants to film a quick segment at the market. She wants to prove to herself she is fine.

The hallway is cooler now, which should be comforting. It is not. It smells faintly of gas. It smells like someone lit a stove and walked away. She pauses outside her door. The air is still. The light above her buzzes.

She opens the door. The window is still open, the curtain fluttering in a weak breeze. The heater is off. The room is colder than she expects, the damp back with a vengeance. The air smells stale, like socks and bleach. She grabs her camera and, for a second, stares at the heater. The warning sticker catches her eye. The Spanish is now familiar. Never operate in a closed room. Risk of poisoning. The words have shifted from warning to accusation.

She looks around for a detector. There isn't one. There is only a dark nail hole above the doorframe, as if something used to be there. She has no proof. It is a guess. It makes her uneasy.

She pulls on her rain jacket and shuts the door. The hallway smells warmer as she leaves, and she tells herself she is being ridiculous. She tells herself gas is a normal smell in old buildings. She tells herself every hostel has something, and if this is the something, she can handle it.

Outside, the city is wet. The rain is a thin mist, the kind that makes your hair limp and your skin cold. The streets are crowded and loud. Mara and Hannah go to the market with Luis and the Swedish couple, a small caravan of backpacks. The market is a riot of color and smell: orange papayas, red tomatoes, piles of herbs like green fists. The air is full of the scent of fried dough and raw fish. Vendors shout. Tourists haggle. A woman in a bright shawl insists Mara taste a fruit that looks like a star. It is sweet and sour and makes her lips pucker.

Mara films everything. She holds her camera out in front of her like a shield. She narrates as she walks, her voice bright, her face angled to catch the better side of her cheekbones. She smiles at a llama sweater and makes a joke about alpacas. She shows the price tags and shakes her head for the viewers back home. She feels normal for five-minute stretches. Then the fog rolls in again. She catches herself missing a step and laughs it off. She takes sips of water even though it doesn't seem to help.

At a juice stand, Hannah orders a beet smoothie and winks at her. "This will cure you," she says. "Beetroot and whatever else they put in."

Mara sips the drink. It's cold and earthy. It tastes like dirt and sugar and the kind of thing her mother would have forced on her when she was sick. She pretends to love it. She buys a second one just in case the placebo works.

The group talks about plans for the afternoon. Luis wants to go to the Basilica. The Swedish couple want to find a laundromat. Hannah wants a nap. Mara says she'll maybe go up to El Panecillo, the hill with the statue, because the view will look good in a thumbnail. She says it with confidence. In her head, she imagines a bed.

Back at the hostel, she feels more tired than she should after a morning of walking. The courtyard is damp, the string lights dull in the daylight. The smell of cooking has been replaced by detergent. She drops her bag and checks her phone. Comments are already appearing on her market video. People like the food. People like the quick cuts and the bright fruit. No one sees her wobble or the way her hands tremble when she is off camera. The performance is working. She should feel pleased. She feels tired.

She heads up to her room to change her shirt. The hallway is warm again. The heaters are on, though the day is not cold. She touches the wall by the stairwell. It is warm, like a mug. There is a new strip of aluminum tape over a vent, smoother than the old peeling one. Someone has fixed it. Or covered it.

She finds a note on her door, a clean white paper with reception's logo. "Room service check. Please keep window closed at night for security." There is a checkmark beside it. The note is in Spanish and English. She stares at it. She thinks about the open window, the laundry wall, the flickering light, the stale air. She thinks about the receptionist's bored face. She thinks about the heater's warning and the lack of detector.

She takes the note down. She puts it in her pocket. It feels like a polite threat.

Inside, she changes her shirt and sits on the edge of the bed. Her head is a dull drum. She wants to lie down for just a second. She tells herself a ten-minute rest will reset her. She sets her phone alarm for fifteen. She lies back. The mattress squeaks. The room is cold. The heater is off. She hesitates. The damp feels like it is crawling into her bones. She flips the heater on and tells herself it's just for a little while, just to take the edge off. She keeps the window open, a crack of gray light and wet air. That should be enough. She sets her alarm again.

The heat blooms. The familiar hot-metal smell returns, wrapped now with the faint sweetness. She pulls the blanket over her and closes her eyes. Her body sighs with relief.

She wakes to the sound of rain hitting the window. Her phone alarm is blaring. It takes her a few seconds to understand it, to find the sound in the fog of her head. She turns it off and sits up. The room is warm. The heater is on. The window is still open, but only by a finger's width. She must have pushed it down in her sleep. The air feels thick. She breathes in and the breath doesn't feel satisfying. She exhales and it feels like she is exhaling less than she inhaled, as if the room is slowly eating air.

She swings her legs off the bed and stands. The floor shifts under her. She holds the desk for balance. Her laptop is open, screen blank. A bead of condensation runs down the inside of the window. She wipes it with her sleeve and leaves a smear. The city outside is a blur of gray.

She should turn the heater off. She should open the window more. She should go downstairs and be with other humans and drink water and stop pretending her body isn't sending her messages. She hears these shoulds as if they are coming from another room.

She turns the heater off anyway. The flame dies. The room goes quiet. She opens the window, properly this time, and cold air pours in. It makes her shiver. She stands there and breathes until the fog in her head thins.

She goes downstairs. The common room is louder now, full of afternoon chatter and the clack of cutlery. She sinks into a chair and lets herself be small. Hannah slides a plate of bread toward her. "Eat," she says. "You're making me nervous."

"You're making me feel loved," Mara says. She breaks a piece of bread and chews. It tastes like nothing, but the act of eating is grounding.

They talk about plans for the evening. There is a free salsa class in the common room, and a bar crawl later. The Swedish couple are already arguing about which bar is more "authentic." Luis is flirting with a woman who has a nose ring and a map of Chile tattooed on her calf.

"You coming?" Hannah asks.

"Maybe," Mara says. She wants to say yes. She wants to be the kind of traveler who does salsa in a hostel and laughs too loudly and posts a video that gets ten thousand views. She also wants to lie in her bed and never get up again.

"Don't pass out again, okay?" Hannah says lightly, but her eyes are serious.

"If I do, at least it's a good story," Mara says. Dark humor, the currency of backpackers. It buys her a laugh and covers the fear.

That night, the water comes back on with a gurgle and a cheer from the bathrooms. People crowd into the shower stalls like it's a festival. Mara waits until later, when the hallway is quieter, and takes a long, hot shower. The steam makes her head feel clear for the first time all day. She stands under the water and lets it beat against her scalp, the heat melting the tension in her shoulders. She closes her eyes. For a moment, she is just a body in hot water, and there is no audience.

When she returns to her room, she hangs her damp clothes on the back of the chair. The humidity in the room is heavy, the kind that makes fabric cling. She looks at the heater. She looks at the wet jeans dripping onto the tile. She thinks about mold and the smell of wet socks and the way damp makes her feel sad.

She flips the heater on.

The flame catches. The metal ticks. The sweet, hot smell returns, stronger now, maybe because the heater has been off for a while. She opens the window a crack. Rain blows in, a light mist that dampens the curtain. She closes the window halfway. It's a compromise. The note on the door about security floats in her mind, a flimsy excuse that feels heavier than it should.

She sits at the desk and edits footage from the market. The screen's blue light makes her eyes ache. She trims clips and adds captions. She dials the brightness down because her head is still thick. The heater hums. The room warms. The damp jeans steam faintly, their smell mingling with the heater's metal breath.

A notification pops up on her phone: a message from a follower. "You look pale. Are you ok?" It is a stranger's concern, which is its own kind of intimacy. She considers ignoring it. She replies instead: "All good! Just the altitude. Quito is wild." She adds a mountain emoji. She hates herself a little for it.

She checks the time. 11:47 p.m. She should sleep. She should turn off the heater. She should open the window. She should go downstairs and ask for another blanket. She should, she should, she should. The list of shoulds is long and quiet.

She clicks "upload" on her video. The progress bar crawls. She waits. The heater's ticking is a metronome. When the upload finishes, she closes her laptop. The room is warm now, too warm. The air is thick. She stands and crosses to the window. Rain has smeared the glass. The laundry building's light is out. The wall is a dark, wet sheet.

She opens the window wider. Cold air rushes in, and with it the smell of the street: wet asphalt, fried oil, distant exhaust. She breathes it in. It doesn't feel like enough. She leans out a little, letting the air wash over her face. She hears a car horn, a dog, a laugh from the courtyard below. Life outside her tiny room, indifferent.

Behind her, the heater clicks. It sounds like a tiny stone being tapped against glass. She turns and looks at it. The flame flickers in the little window, a blue tongue. It looks alive. It looks hungry.

Her head starts to ache again. A slow throb. She rubs her temples. She tells herself it's the screen time, the altitude, the day. She tells herself she should drink water. She drinks from her bottle. The water tastes faintly like plastic.

She undresses and climbs into bed. The blanket is still thin. The warmth from the heater is a relief. The window is open. The room is not sealed. It should be safe. She repeats the logic to herself like a prayer. She sets her phone alarm for 7 a.m. again, a stubborn commitment to the rooftop yoga she will probably skip.

She lies on her back and watches the ceiling. The fan of light from the hallway leaks under the door. The heater hums. The room smells of rain and metal and the faint sweetness that always follows the heater's breath. Her eyelids are heavy. Her thoughts drift.

She thinks about the message from the unknown account. "Heaters in Quito kill. Be careful." She thinks about the warning sticker, the missing detector, the taped vent, the hallway warmth. She thinks about the receptionist's shrug. She thinks about how her followers joked about dying. She thinks about how the joke is starting to feel like a dare.

She turns onto her side. She tells herself she is being paranoid. She tells herself she can handle it. She tells herself to sleep.

The room feels smaller as she drifts. The air feels thick. The heater ticks. The rain taps the window like fingernails. Her body starts to sink into the mattress, heavy and slow. She closes her eyes.

In the dark, something small and ordinary happens: the window slides shut a few centimeters, nudged by the wind, just enough to catch on the frame. The air changes without a sound.

Mara doesn't notice. She is already asleep.
