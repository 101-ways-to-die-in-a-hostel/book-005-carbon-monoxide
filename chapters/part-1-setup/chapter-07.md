# Chapter 07: The Rules of Air

The message still glows in her head when she wakes: Not tonight.

Her phone lies face down on the nightstand, its screen dark and innocent. The air in the room is cold enough to sting her nostrils, and the fan is still dead, its blades frozen mid-blur. The window is cracked but narrower than she left it, the stool angled like a tired guard. The heater is off. The room still smells faintly sweet, like caramel that has gone too far.

She sits up and waits for the thud in her head. It arrives, late and dull. The headache is no longer a scream, but it is a constant hum, a mosquito you cannot swat. She listens for the soft beeping she heard in the night. Nothing. The hallway is quiet. The hostel is holding its breath.

She checks her phone anyway. A new text from Hannah at 6:41 a.m.: "You ok?" A second one at 6:58: "Answer me, I will haunt you." Mara smiles and types, "Alive. Cold. Fan died." She doesn't mention the message. She doesn't mention the word tonight.

She swings her feet to the floor and the tile bites her. She shivers, then reaches for her hoodie, pulling it over damp hair that still smells faintly of shampoo. The room feels like a refrigerator now, the damp cold that gets into your bones and sits there. She looks at the heater and feels an old, persuasive pull. The idea of warmth is a warm thing all its own.

She doesn't turn it on.

She wedges the stool harder against the window, adds the water bottle for weight, and cracks the door to the hallway, letting the warmer air bleed in. It smells like bleach and coffee and the same faint sweetness she can't stop noticing. She takes a cautious breath. It tastes normal enough.

She stands in the draft a moment, hoodie half-zipped, deciding if she is a person who can be cold in exchange for being alive. The thought has the melodrama of a movie trailer. She is aware of that and still can't shake it. She glances at the oxygen can on her nightstand. The can is childish and absurd, and she is too tired to be embarrassed by it. She tucks it into her bag anyway. If nothing else, it is a prop for the lie she keeps telling herself: I am handling this.

Downstairs, the common room is in its early-morning quiet. A few people sleep on couches, shoes off, mouths open. The coffee pot is already on, the smell burnt and comforting. The compass-tattoo guy is not on his couch. The blanket is folded. The empty space looks like someone erased him.

On the far wall, a fresh flyer sits over the world map, taped with new corners that still curl a little. The headline reads SECURITY NOTICE in Spanish and English, the letters rounded and cheerful. KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED AFTER 9 P.M. There are tiny padlocks printed along the bottom, as if a row of smiling locks could make the words feel friendly.

Hannah is at the long table with a mug and a guidebook, her hair damp, her face bright with the kind of sleep Mara isn't getting. She looks up, relief flickering across her expression. "You look like someone who fought a lamp and lost," she says.

"The lamp won," Mara says. She sits across from Hannah and wraps her hands around a mug of coffee Hannah pushes toward her. The heat is a small mercy.

"Did you sleep?" Hannah asks.

"A little," Mara says. "The fan died in the night. Power flickered, I think." She lifts the mug. "Maybe the hostel is haunted." She tries to make it light.

Hannah doesn't laugh. "I heard a beeping around three. Did you hear it?"

Mara nods. "Thought it was a phone alarm. It stopped." She keeps her eyes on the coffee. The steam smells like ash.

Hannah taps the table. "The guy from room seven went to the clinic this morning. The receptionist said he was 'fine.' He was not fine." She makes air quotes. "They put him on oxygen again. He paid cash and left. I think he's checking out."

Mara watches a new guest stumble in, fresh rain on his jacket and a grin that still has hope in it. He drops his bag on the floor and asks in slow English if this is the place with the rooftop yoga. The receptionist nods and hands him a key, then taps the security flyer with one finger. The guest nods like it's normal. Mara wonders if she should say something, anything. She says nothing.

Mara glances at the empty couch and feels something turn in her stomach. The compass guy had offered her a painkiller like a handshake. She imagines him hauling his backpack down the stairs with a headache and a warning he can't prove.

"Maybe I should go," Mara says, and hears how small it sounds. The thought of leaving is an open door and a cold street. The thought of staying is a warm room and a closed window. The math is simple. The math is hard.

"You should go," Hannah says, too quickly. She softens. "Or at least move rooms. Or sleep in the dorm. Something that isn't your room."

"They said they're full," Mara says.

"They say a lot," Hannah says. She taps the guidebook. "Let's go out. Fresh air. If you stay in this building all day, you're going to start seeing the walls breathe."

Mara almost laughs. The walls already feel like they're breathing.

She nods. "Okay. Let's go." She takes a sip of coffee and winces at the bitter taste. It is still better than the taste of metal.

---

The city is gray and washed clean, the kind of morning that smells like wet stone and street food. Mara and Hannah walk toward the old town, past vendors setting up their carts, past a man polishing shoes on a sidewalk bench. The air outside is thin and sharp. It cuts. It also clears.

Mara films a short clip of a vendor flipping empanadas on a greasy griddle, the oil popping like tiny fireworks. She smiles into the lens and narrates a line about local breakfast, about the smell of cumin, about the way the steam makes the air look dreamy. When she lowers the camera, the dreaminess disappears. The smoke smells faintly like the heater and she turns her face away, pretending to check her footage.

Mara feels her head loosen as they walk. Not fully, not quickly, but enough to remind her what normal feels like. She notices small things: the orange rinds piled like a heap of tiny suns, the way the cobblestones shine, the way a stray dog sleeps with its nose under its tail as if the world isn't wet and cold around it.

At a corner, a group of tourists cluster around a guide holding a laminated map. He speaks loudly in English about churches and plazas and altitude. Mara knows the script. She has given it, in a different form, to a thousand viewers. She glances at Hannah.

"Do you want a tour?" Hannah asks.

"Do I want to walk slowly behind a man with a flag?" Mara says. "On brand." She forces a smile. The joke doesn't lift the heaviness.

They settle for a cafe with an open front and metal chairs. The smell of baking bread, coffee, and damp jackets mixes in the air. A man at the counter is grinding beans, the sound a small, aggressive buzz. Mara sits near the open doorway, her knees close to the street air.

"I feel better outside," she says. She says it like she's reporting the weather.

"You should say that to the receptionist," Hannah says. Her eyes are sharp.

"He'd shrug." Mara sips a coca tea instead of coffee. It tastes like wet leaves and hope. She glances at her phone. A new message from her mother: "Any better today?" She types, "Better. Out for a walk." She adds a heart and sends it.

Another message, from the blank account, pops in beneath it. "They sealed the vents last week. It traps the exhaust." Her throat tightens. She looks around the cafe, at the woman typing on a laptop, at the man in a poncho sipping espresso, at the rain streaking the sidewalk. The message feels like a finger poking her from inside a crowd.

She opens her camera roll and scrolls through the last few days. Her face is bright in the footage, her eyes a little too shiny. There is a moment on the rooftop where she laughs and the laugh dies mid-breath. There is another moment in the market where she leans against a fruit stand for a second too long. She deletes nothing. She also cannot stop watching it. The camera has been more honest than she has.

She shows it to Hannah. Hannah reads, then lifts her eyes. "How do they know?"

"No idea," Mara says. "It could be a guess." It doesn't feel like a guess.

Hannah leans forward. "We can go to another hostel today. Just look. Ask. You don't have to decide. But we should have a backup." She says it like a plan, and plans are the only things that keep Mara from feeling like she is floating.

They walk two blocks and peek into a different hostel, a place with bright walls and an aggressively clean lobby. The receptionist there smiles and offers a printed rate sheet. The prices are higher. The rooms are smaller. The building looks newer and is probably as creaky, just with a better paint job. Mara takes the sheet anyway and folds it into her pocket. It feels like permission she hasn't used yet.

Outside, a taxi driver calls to them. "Centro? Mitad del Mundo?" He points with his chin. Hannah shakes her head. Mara shakes her head. The man shrugs and rolls his window up. The word mundo hangs for a second. World. Half of it. The irony is not lost on her.

On the way back, they pass a pharmacy window with smoke detectors stacked like pancakes. Mara stands and stares at them. She wonders if smoke detectors can detect anything that isn't smoke. She wonders if the hostel would even let her install one. She imagines the manager's polite smile.

At a stall selling scarves, she buys a cheap knit beanie because it is cold and because it feels like doing something. The seller wraps it in a plastic bag. The bag crackles like a small warning.

Back near the hostel, Hannah stops. "We should talk to the manager again," she says.

"We did. He said check out if I'm not comfortable." Mara hears the words and feels her pride rise. It is a small, sharp thing. It tells her she can handle this, that she is not the kind of person who flees. It is not always right.

They pause at the hostel gate. A woman steps out, dragging a suitcase too large for the narrow sidewalk. Her eyes are red, her jaw set. She mutters in Spanish to the man beside her about a headache and a closed window. The man nods and says nothing. Mara doesn't know whether to offer advice or keep walking. She keeps walking, and the guilt follows like a shadow.

Hannah looks at her. "Your pride is loud," she says.

Mara laughs. It is a thin, tired sound. "You're not wrong."

They walk into the lobby. The manager is there, sweater vest and clipboard, speaking to a couple with fresh backpacks. He smiles at them in the way people smile when they are doing customer service. Mara waits until he is done.

"We need a different room," Hannah says. She says it with the calm of someone who has stopped caring about being polite.

The manager looks at his clipboard. "Full," he says. He does not look surprised.

"Then we need a space where she can sleep with fresh air," Hannah says.

He nods, as if understanding, and points at the open courtyard. "You can stay in the common room if you want," he says. "We do not allow sleeping on couches, but you can sit. The dorm is full." He shrugs. "If you are uncomfortable, you are welcome to check out." The words are an open door, and he says them like a script.

Mara feels the old, hot pressure behind her eyes. It is not just the headache. It is anger and fear and the small humiliation of being told she is optional. She wants to say something sharp. She wants to say something brave. Instead she nods and walks away because it is easier than a scene.

---

By late afternoon, the hostel is busy again. New guests arrive, the air fills with the scrape of backpacks and the clatter of keys. Mara sits in the courtyard with her laptop and the fan at her feet, its hum a small, steady companion. She edits a video of the cable car ride and keeps cutting away from the parts where her hands shake.

She posts a quick story: the mountains, the sky, a caption about fresh air and perspective. She leaves out the part about the clinic and the mask. She leaves out the part about the message that says the vents are sealed. The lie is smooth now, practiced. She watches the views tick up and feels a small, hollow satisfaction.

A new sign appears on the bulletin board. It is printed in Spanish and English, taped beside the tour ads: FOR YOUR SAFETY, PLEASE KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED AFTER 9 P.M. THERE HAVE BEEN THEFTS. THANK YOU. The words are bold. The paper is fresh.

Mara stares at it. The courtyard seems suddenly smaller. She thinks of the doctor, of the oxygen mask, of the word poisoning. She thinks of the message: sealed vents. She thinks of the new tape glinting in the hallway.

She rips the sign down. She tells herself she will take it to the manager. She folds it into her pocket instead, the paper warm from her hand. It feels like proof and also like something she is hiding.

The maintenance guy appears again, roll of tape in his hand. He walks toward the stairwell, head down. Mara watches him go. She can't tell if she is relieved or terrified that he is still taping.

At the next table, two girls compare hostel stories. One talks about a place in Lima with bed bugs. The other talks about a place in Medellin where a laptop got stolen through an open window. The theft story floats through the courtyard and lands like a pebble in Mara's shoe. Security is real. So is poison. She wishes the world offered one problem at a time.

In the common room, the receptionist is setting out plastic cups for a free welcome drink. He sees Mara and nods, as if nothing has happened. He hands her a cup of something sugary and pink. It tastes like fruit syrup and alcohol. She drinks it because it is there and because she needs the sugar.

Hannah appears with a backpack over one shoulder. "I'm going to a museum," she says. "Want to come?"

"I should edit," Mara says. The words feel like an excuse. She knows it. Hannah knows it.

"Come anyway," Hannah says. "You can edit later. You can edit anywhere. You can't edit if you're on the floor again." She lifts an eyebrow.

Mara sighs. "Okay. Ten minutes to grab my camera." She stands and the world tilts briefly, then settles. She makes a face at herself in the window's reflection.

Upstairs, the hallway is warm and smells faintly sweet. Mara's room is cold and damp. The fan is on the desk, the window open, the stool braced. She grabs her camera and the knit beanie and hesitates at the door, looking back at the heater as if it might speak.

She thinks about leaving it off, about leaving the window open, about leaving the door cracked for air. She also thinks about security and theft and the new sign. She thinks about the manager's smile. She thinks about the note: Not tonight.

She closes the door and follows Hannah down the stairs.

The museum is small and warm, a quiet place where the air smells like dust and varnished wood. Mara likes the way the silence presses down. She takes photos of ancient masks and ceramics and tries to feel present. She does, for a while. Her head is clearer outside the hostel. The clarity makes her angry in a slow, steady way.

One mask catches her eye: a carved face with hollowed eyes and a mouth drilled into a perfect O. The plaque says it was used in a ritual to call breath back to the body. Mara reads it twice. She imagines a room full of people chanting while one person lies still, waiting for air to come back. She can't decide if the idea is comforting or ridiculous. She takes a photo anyway, framing it so her reflection doesn't show.

They drift into a side room with a display of old mining tools. There is a placard about oxygen, about how men went down into the earth with candles because the flame told them if the air was safe. If the candle died, they left. Simple, brutal, clear. Mara stares at the tiny illustration of a candle and thinks about her heater's blue flame, about how it flickers when the room is closed, about how she has used it as a comfort instead of a warning. She laughs under her breath and gets a look from Hannah, so she pretends she is laughing at a bad translation on the sign.

In the gift shop, Hannah buys a postcard of a mountain and a magnet shaped like a llama. Mara buys nothing. She looks at a shelf of little ceramic bells and wonders if any of them sound like a detector. She doesn't say it out loud. The joke feels too sharp.

By the time they return, it is dusk. The hostel glows yellow through the rain. The new sign is still on the board, taped again. Someone has added a smiley face in the corner, as if that makes it less of a threat.

Hannah looks at Mara. "You could stay in my dorm tonight," she says. "We can make space. The girls are fine. You'll be noisy with all your gear, but they won't care."

Mara looks toward the stairs. The decision feels like a cliff. "I should," she says. It comes out as a whisper.

"Then do it," Hannah says.

Mara takes a breath. "I will." She doesn't know if she believes herself.

---

The hostel fills with laughter as night settles. People cluster in the common room for the welcome drink, then spill out toward the bar crawl. The air smells like beer and wet clothes. The reception sign about windows sits on the wall, bright and new, a small square of paper with big consequences.

Mara goes upstairs to pack a small bag. The hallway is warmer than it should be. The heaters hum. The taped vents catch the light and look glossy, like wet bandages. She pauses outside room nine and listens. The hallway is loud with footsteps and voices, but underneath it all she hears the faint, patient ticking of heaters.

She passes a backpacker in a soccer jersey standing by the stairwell, sniffing the air. "Smells like cookies," he says to no one in particular. He grins as if it's a gift. Mara nods, but the smell makes her stomach twist.

Inside her room, the cold is a slap. She closes the window for a moment to stop the curtain from flapping while she packs, then freezes with her hand on the latch. She hears the doctor's voice: no heater in a closed room. She hears the manager: security or air. She hears her own fear: not tonight.

She opens the window again, shoves the stool into place, and leaves it.

She packs a change of clothes, her toiletries, her phone charger, and the oxygen can. The can makes a small clink in her bag, a ridiculous traveling companion. She hesitates on her laptop, on her camera, on the hard drive. She leaves them. The idea of hauling her whole life to the dorm feels like admitting defeat. She hates that she cares.

She opens the drawer and finds the note from reception about keeping the window closed. She turns it over and writes OPEN WINDOW in block letters on the back, as if a new rule can overwrite the old. She leaves it on the desk, a dare to herself.

She turns to go and notices something she hadn't before: a thin line of soot on the wall above the heater, a crescent like a fingernail. It wasn't there the first day. Or she didn't see it. She runs her thumb along it and the black smears, a soft shadow on her skin.

She steps into the hallway and pulls the door closed. The latch catches. The room behind her breathes its own air now.

In Hannah's dorm, the air is colder and louder. Six bunks, six strangers, the smell of deodorant and damp socks. It is not cozy. It is safe. She takes a lower bunk near the window and wedges it open with a shoe. The air that comes in is cold and wet and perfect.

The girl in the bunk above her rolls over and peers down, hair a dark halo in the dim light. "You okay?" she whispers, her voice thick with sleep.

"Yeah," Mara whispers back. "Just need air." The girl nods like that makes sense and burrows into her blanket again.

She lies back and listens to the dorm noises: snoring, whispers, the shuffling of someone turning over. It is human, messy, alive. She should feel relieved. Instead she feels a twitch of guilt about leaving her gear alone. She tells herself that is the cost of living.

Her phone buzzes. A message from the blank account: "Do not trust their signs. Air is the only rule." She stares at it. The blue glow of the screen makes the bunk above her look like a ceiling in a cave. She wants to reply, Who are you? She doesn't. The message fades into the thread of unanswered warnings.

She hears a door slam down the hall, then the low murmur of voices. The dorm door opens and closes. A girl climbs into the bunk opposite, her breath smelling like beer. The room settles.

Mara lies back and listens to the building sigh. The dorm is a chorus of small noises: fabric shifting, a phone buzzing and then silenced, the distant clank of someone washing a cup. It is messy and alive, which is exactly what her private room never sounds like. She thinks of her camera sitting alone on the desk, the heater squatting like a pet she is afraid to pet. She thinks about how much she wants to be brave and how much of that want is just stubbornness wearing a nice jacket.

Mara's eyes drift shut, the cold air brushing her face. The mattress is thin. Her back aches. She does not care.

Then, somewhere down the hall, a sharp sound rings out. A small chirp, then another, the short, urgent beep of a detector.

She sits up, heart thudding. The dorm stirs. Someone groans and turns over. The beeping stops. The hallway goes quiet again.

Mara holds her breath, listening. The dorm air smells clean. The hall air, when it leaks under the door, smells faintly sweet.

She gets out of bed and pads to the door. Her hand hovers over the handle. She thinks about her room, her camera, the heater on the wall. She thinks about the sign downstairs that says to close windows at night. She thinks about the note in her pocket and the message on her phone.

She opens the door a crack. Warm air rushes in, thick and sugary. The hallway is dim. Halfway down, a light flickers above room nine.

She hears a soft click, like a heater cycling on.

Mara closes the door quietly, but she doesn't go back to bed.
