# Chapter 03: The Sweetness in the Air

Mara wakes already tired, as if sleep has been a brief intermission instead of a cure.

She blinks into a room that feels too close. The air is warm and damp, the kind of warmth that clings to skin. Her tongue is dry, her mouth metallic. When she swallows, it feels like she swallowed a coin. She sits up and the world doesn't tilt so much as lag, her vision catching up a beat late.

The window is almost closed. It sits with the stubbornness of a door that wants to be shut, the latch caught. A thin line of dawn light bleeds around the curtain, a pale scalpel. She stares at it for a second, trying to remember if she closed it. She doesn't remember. The thought floats in her head like a balloon with no string.

She swings her legs off the bed and stands. The heater is on. The blue flame looks innocent, a steady eye. Her nose catches a smell, faintly sweet, like burnt sugar. It makes her think of caramelizing onions, of toasted marshmallows, of gas stoves on camping trips. She looks down at the heater's warning sticker, the Spanish blunt and tired. She doesn't need the translation anymore.

She crosses the room and pushes the window open. The cold air rushes in, sharp and wet, and she inhales greedily. The relief is immediate and then it fades, leaving the headache in place. She presses her fingers to her temples. The pressure doesn't help.

Her stomach rolls, a slow wave. She waits it out, staring at the laundry wall outside, its bricks dark and slick. A pigeon lands on the ledge, tilts its head at her, then lifts off again, unimpressed. The world outside seems cleaner, farther away.

She turns off the heater. The flame dies and the room loses its heartbeat. For a second, the silence is loud.

On her phone, the time reads 9:07. She has slept through the yoga she promised she'd do. She feels a small wash of guilt and then the heavier tide of fatigue. It's late enough that she can pretend she chose to sleep.

She checks her messages. A text from her mom at 7:22: "You ok?" Another from Hannah at 8:10: "Roof yoga casualty?" She replies with a joke to both, because jokes are easier than truth. She tells her mom the altitude is hitting her but she'll be fine. She tells Hannah she'll make it up to her with coffee.

The room is still too warm. She opens the door and the hallway's heat rolls in, an invisible blanket. The smell in the hall is stronger, a warm toast smell with a hint of metal. It makes her stomach flip. She tells herself it's the kitchen downstairs. She tells herself she is being dramatic.

Across the hall, a door opens. A man with a shaved head and a compass tattoo steps out, shirtless, hair wet. He pauses, looking at her like he's taking her temperature with his eyes. "You okay?" he asks. His accent is Brazilian, his voice casual.

"Just the altitude," she says, a line she's practiced. He nods like he has heard it before and wanders toward the stairs, dripping onto the tiles. The trail of water looks like a map of somewhere she doesn't want to go.

She dresses in slow motion, every movement a small argument with gravity. Her hoodie hangs off her shoulders. She catches her reflection in the mirror on the back of the door and thinks she looks like someone who didn't sleep, which is accurate. She splashes water on her face from her bottle and the cold makes her flinch.

Downstairs, the common room is loud in that morning-after way, people laughing too hard at last night's stories because that's what hostels are for. The air smells like coffee and wet shoes. Mara wedges herself onto a couch and waits for the room to stop moving, which it isn't, so she pretends it is.

Hannah appears with two mugs. "Survivor," she says, handing one to Mara. The tea is pale and smells like grass. Mara wraps her hands around it for warmth and for something to do.

"You're late," Hannah says, but there is no bite. She looks at Mara's face and frowns. "You look awful. Like in a chic, tragic way. But awful." She reaches out and presses the back of her hand to Mara's forehead. "No fever." She pauses. "Or you're dead and just cold. That would explain a lot."

Mara laughs, a small sound. "Altitude is bullying me," she says.

"Altitude is a poor excuse," Hannah says. She leans back. "Also, I heard the receptionist telling someone last night they shouldn't open their windows because of theft. Did you hear that?" She raises an eyebrow. "Because if a thief can get in, so can fresh air, and I'm not sure which I'm more afraid of."

Mara thinks about the note on her door. She thinks about the closed window. She thinks about the sweetness in the air. "Yeah," she says. "They left a note. Security, blah blah."

Hannah makes a face. "I'd rather lose a phone than my lungs."

Mara takes a sip of tea. It tastes like nothing. "It's probably fine," she says. She hears the lie as she says it.

At the long table, the German guys are already planning a day trip. A map is spread out like a hostage. Luis is leaning over it, saying something in Portuguese and Spanish and English, a language all his own. A woman with a nose ring is drawing circles with a pen and laughing too loudly. The hostel is a machine that produces connection, and Mara usually likes that. Today, it feels like a sea she is standing beside rather than in.

She opens her laptop and tries to edit, but the screen makes her eyes ache. She checks her latest video. People have commented. "You look tired, rest up!" "Be careful in Quito!" "Is that heater safe?" She scrolls past them, liking the easy ones.

The receptionist walks through the common room, dragging a cart stacked with fresh towels. He stops by the kitchen door and wedges it open with his foot. "Windows closed at night," he calls, not to anyone in particular. "We had a theft last week." He taps a little sign on the wall that says, in crooked English, "Keep windows shut for your safe." The sign is laminated and smudged, a warning that has outlived its urgency. The word safe sits there like a dare.

A new comment pings in, private message style. It's from the same blank account as yesterday, the numbers-and-nothing avatar. "Heaters in that hostel leak. Ask for a detector." The message is blunt, unadorned. It could be a troll. It could be a guardian angel. It could be a bored backpacker who knows what she's going through and can't be bothered to do it kindly.

She stares at it. Her thumb hovers over the reply box. She closes it instead. The message disappears into her inbox. She tells herself she'll ask at reception about a detector. She tells herself she doesn't want to be seen as paranoid. She tells herself she'll ask later.

Hannah nudges her knee. "We're doing the basilica at noon. You in?"

Mara doesn't want to do anything at noon. She wants to be horizontal. She wants to disappear into clean air and sleep. But she is a person on an adventure, and people on adventures go to basilicas. "Sure," she hears herself say. "If I don't pass out on the steps."

"If you do, at least it's in a beautiful building," Hannah says. "Good lighting for your collapse."

The dark humor feels like a handshake. Mara smiles because it's easier than confessing fear.

By noon, the sky is a bruise. The basilica's stone towers rise like teeth against it. The city around them is damp and loud, the streets slippery with rain and spilled fruit. Mara walks with the group, her camera in her pocket. The air outside is a blessing. It smells like wet concrete and street food and car exhaust, real and immediate. It makes her head feel clearer, if not better.

The basilica steps are steep. Mara pauses halfway up and presses a hand to her chest. Her heart is doing a small sprint. She tells herself it's the altitude, the stairs, the heavy air. She tells herself a lot of things.

Inside, the church is cool and echoing. The stained glass is bright, the color of candy. The gargoyles outside are shaped like iguanas, and a tour guide insists on telling them about it twice. Mara takes a photo and jokes about the lizards guarding God's house. It gets a laugh. Her head pulses with each beat of the organ music.

When they climb the tower, the steps narrow and tilt. The group moves in a line, passing in inches. The air gets thinner. Mara grips the railing, her knuckles white. She focuses on her breath, in and out, as if she is practicing something meaningful. The stone is damp under her palm. It feels alive in a cold way.

At the top, the wind hits her face and she feels, for the first time all day, sharp and awake. The view is wide: a scattering of roofs, the mountains beyond, the city in gray layers. She holds her phone up and takes a photo, the kind her followers like. The wind dries the sweat on the back of her neck. She could stay here all day just for the air.

"You're pale again," Hannah says when she returns from the edge. She says it quietly. "Do you want to sit?"

"I'm okay," Mara says, automatically. It is her reflex. She is a person who says she's okay. It's part of the brand. She smiles and changes the subject. "These stairs are a scam."

Luis laughs and offers her a piece of candy he bought from a woman at the church door. It is hard and lemony. She takes it to be polite, and the sugar gives her a brief jolt. She stands at the parapet and watches a dog trot across a rooftop, a small moving speck of life. She feels a flicker of joy and a larger swell of exhaustion.

On the way down, her knees wobble. The narrow stairwell amplifies her breathing. She doesn't want to be the slow one, the weak one. She puts her head down and counts steps.

Outside, the market noise hits her like a wave. A street vendor is selling roasted corn, the smell sweet and smoky. The sweetness twists her stomach. She thinks, irrationally, of the heater. She tells herself she is hungry. She buys a cob and eats it anyway. It tastes like smoke and butter. The smoke smells like gas. She can't tell the difference anymore.

They wander through a plaza with a carousel and a man selling DVDs with a grin that doesn't reach his eyes. Rain begins again, fine and cold. The group huddles under umbrellas. Mara pulls her hoodie up and watches the rain turn the city into a watercolor. She is a tourist in the picture of someone else.

At a café, they sit on plastic chairs and drink coffee. The café is warm, too warm, and her head starts to throb again. The air inside is thick with espresso and wet coats. She sets her coffee down and pushes it away. The bitter smell makes her nauseous.

"You okay?" Luis asks, his accent softening the concern.

"Just a headache," she says. "Maybe too much coffee, not enough water." She lifts her water bottle and takes a sip to prove the point.

"Altitude and roasted corn," Hannah says, as if offering a diagnosis. "It'll take you out."

Mara laughs. It sounds wrong. She forces it. The ceiling fan ticks overhead, pushing air that doesn't feel fresh. She realizes she is thinking about air a lot lately. She doesn't like that.

On the café wall, a faded poster advertises a "mal de altura" remedy: coca tea and rest. The picture shows a smiling tourist holding a mug. The promise is simple. She orders one out of stubbornness. The tea is grassy and numbing, and for ten minutes she convinces herself it helps. It feels good to believe in something small and ordinary.

They talk about plans for the night. There's a salsa class in the common room. There's a bar crawl after. The Swedish couple are in. Luis is in. Hannah is undecided. Mara says yes, because saying no feels like letting the fog win.

They leave the café and walk back toward the hostel. The air outside is better. She breathes it in like medicine. The hostel appears at the end of the street, its paint peeling and its sign flickering. It looks like a tired animal in the rain.

At reception, the bored clerk is still there, a creature of habit. Mara asks, trying to sound casual, "Do you have a carbon monoxide detector? Like a portable one?"

He looks at her as if she asked for a sword. "Detector?" He shifts his coffee cup from one hand to the other.

"Yeah. For the heater. Just to be safe." She tries to smile. It feels stiff.

He shrugs. "Rooms have ventilation. It's fine." He points toward a sign on the wall that says, in Spanish, "Ventilate rooms daily." The English translation underneath says, "Open window." The font is cheerful.

She notices a small white square above the reception desk, an old smoke detector with its light dead. The plastic is yellowed, the edges dusty. There is no matching square on her room's ceiling. The absence has weight. She looks at it too long and the receptionist clears his throat.

"Mine doesn't have a detector," she says. She hears the edge in her voice.

He shrugs again. "Old building. No detector. If you want extra blanket, we can give." He reaches under the desk and pulls out a folded wool blanket. It smells like storage.

She should take it and keep the heater off. She should insist on moving rooms. She should make a fuss. Instead, she takes the blanket because it is easier than making a scene, and she is tired, and tired people choose the path of least resistance. She thanks him and retreats, the blanket a warm, heavy promise on her arm.

By evening, the hostel has transformed. The common room is pushed open for the salsa class, the couches lined up against the walls like spectators. The lights are dimmer, the air warmer. A speaker blasts a Latin playlist and the floor vibrates under her feet.

Mara sits on the edge of a couch and watches as people pair off. Luis is already dancing with the woman with the nose ring, his body loose and sure. The Swedish couple look confused but game. Hannah stands near the wall, arms crossed, a smile on her face that says she is waiting to be convinced.

Mara wants to dance. She also wants to sit and be still and let the music wash over her. She chooses stillness. Her body feels like it is made of wet sand. She blames the altitude. She blames the day. She does not blame the heater.

"Come on," Hannah says, holding out a hand. "You need to move the bad vibes out of your body."

"I have a lot of bad vibes," Mara says.

"We can sweat them out," Hannah says.

Mara stands. The room spins slightly. She pretends it doesn't. She takes Hannah's hand and lets herself be pulled into the loose circle of dancers. The instructor claps and counts, and Mara tries to follow, her feet a beat late. She laughs at herself and it comes out real. For a minute, she forgets her headache. The music is loud and the room is hot and her body moves and this is what she wanted from travel.

Then she turns too fast. The world tilts. She loses the beat. Her stomach lurches. She steps back, hands on her knees, breathing hard. Sweat slides down her spine. The room is too warm, too crowded. The air feels heavy and thin at once, as if someone has replaced it with a lesser version.

"Hey," Hannah says, leaning in. "Sit. Drink water." She steers her to the couch. Mara sits. The cushion is soft and smells faintly of mildew. The dampness in the room is a presence, a thing.

She sips from her bottle. The water is lukewarm. She forces herself to breathe slow. Around her, the class continues, laughter and music and clapping. The hostel is alive, and she feels apart from it, behind glass.

After the class, the bar crawl forms like a herd. People gather their wallets and phones and make plans. Luis waves at her. "Coming?"

She should. She is twenty-seven and in Quito and she is supposed to say yes. She hears her own voice say, "I'm going to sit this one out. Headache." She forces a smile. "Have one for me."

Luis makes a sympathetic sound. He doesn't push. Hannah sits beside her instead. "You sure?" she asks.

"Yeah," Mara says. "Just tired." She leans back on the couch and feels its damp cold. She wishes she were in her room. Then she remembers the heater. She doesn't know what she wants.

The group leaves. The common room empties, its laughter trailing down the stairs. The staff cleans up, stacking chairs and wiping down tables. The room gets quiet. The air feels heavier in the silence.

She goes to the kitchen for water. The tap runs cold and sputtering, and the metal taste is back as soon as it hits her tongue. She rinses her mouth anyway. Above the sink, a laminated checklist hangs crooked. "TURN OFF HEATERS," it reads in Spanish, with English beneath in smaller letters. Someone has scribbled a smiley face next to it with a marker. The smiley has dripped, its mouth a sad curve. In the corner of the kitchen, a cleaner is folding a pile of sheets, her hands efficient. The woman looks up and gives Mara a tired nod. Her eyes are red, as if from steam or exhaustion. She points her chin toward the hallway. "Mucho calor arriba," she says. Too much heat upstairs. She says it like it's a complaint about weather, not warning. Mara shrugs, because it's all she can think to do.

"You should go to bed," Hannah says after a while. "You look... glassy." She says it gently, like a friend and not a nurse.

"I will," Mara says. She stands. The room sways. She steadies herself on the back of the couch. She adds a joke. "If I die, clear my search history."

Hannah snorts. "If you die, I'm taking your hair products."

"Fair," Mara says.

They hug in the hallway. Hannah's jacket smells like rain and shampoo. It is a human smell. Mara wants to hold it for longer, but she doesn't. She climbs the stairs, one step at a time, the blanket from reception folded over her arm like a trophy.

The hallway is warm again. The heaters are on. The air has that faint sweetness, like someone baking cookies in another room. The sweetness sits at the back of her throat. She presses her tongue to her teeth and tastes pennies. She shakes her head, as if that will dislodge it.

At the top of the stairs, someone has scrawled a joke in marker on the wall: a crude drawing of a skull wearing earmuffs and the words, "SLEEP TIGHT." It could be from a bored backpacker. It could be from something else. She stares at it long enough for the drawing to look back.

She opens her door. The room is cold now, the damp a cold hand on her skin. The window is open a few inches. The curtain flutters. The room smells of wet fabric and metal. She turns on the light and drops the blanket on the bed.

She debates the heater. She stares at it, the squat metal body, the warning sticker, the taped vent above. She thinks about the receptionist's shrug. She thinks about the blank message. She thinks about her headache that hasn't gone away all day, just moved around like a bored houseguest. She thinks about the blanket.

She pulls the blanket around her shoulders and decides to leave the heater off for now. She sits at the desk and scrolls through footage from the basilica. The wind on the tower, the gargoyles, the smile on her face that doesn't show the nausea. She selects a clip and adds a caption. "Breathless in Quito" with a little mountain emoji. She laughs at the double meaning, though it's a laugh she doesn't really feel.

Her phone buzzes. A comment on the post. "Hope you're okay! Did you ever get that detector?" She frowns. The message is from a real-looking account this time, not the blank one. A woman with a profile picture of a cat. It feels more sincere. It also feels like someone is watching her from a safe distance.

She puts the phone down. She takes a shower in the shared bathroom, the water hot and forgiving. The steam makes her head feel clearer. She stands under it longer than she should, because the warmth is clean warmth, not the heater's hot breath. When she comes back to her room, her hair is wet and the air feels cold and thick again.

She wraps herself in the blanket and sits on the bed. The damp in the room sinks into her. She shivers. The heater calls to her like a warm hand. She looks at the window. It is open a crack. The rain outside has softened to a hiss. The security note is in her pocket. The thought of someone reaching in through the window in the middle of the night feels dramatic, but the thought sticks.

She flips the heater on.

The flame catches. The room begins to warm. The metal ticks. The sweet smell returns, subtle at first, then a little stronger. She opens the window wider and tells herself that is enough. She lays the extra blanket over the thin one and climbs in. The warmth is immediate and comforting. It feels like being hugged by a machine.

She thinks about asking for a different room. She imagines the receptionist's shrug, the hallway heat, the vacant look in his eyes. She imagines the hassle of moving her things, the hassle of explaining. She does nothing. The path of least resistance feels like a warm tunnel.

She scrolls through her feed in the dark, the screen's glow a pale rectangle. People are living other lives. She is living hers. She wants to post something honest and then remembers she doesn't know how. She sets her alarm for 7 a.m. again, more from stubbornness than hope.

She turns off the light. The room is a pocket of warmth and wet air. The heater hums. The window is open to a finger's width. The curtain breathes in and out. She feels heavy, more than tired, like her bones have been filled with something dense and sleepy.

She closes her eyes and waits for sleep. It comes quickly, too quickly. It drops her like a trapdoor.

In the night, the wind shifts. The curtain lifts and falls. The window slides toward closed, not enough to latch, just enough to narrow the gap. The room grows warmer. The heater hums a little louder. The air becomes thick, and Mara breathes it in without knowing she is doing it. She dreams again of water, warm and dark, the surface just out of reach. In the dream, she doesn't fight. She floats.

Somewhere in the hostel, a door opens and closes. Someone laughs. The heater ticks. The room breathes.

Mara does not.
