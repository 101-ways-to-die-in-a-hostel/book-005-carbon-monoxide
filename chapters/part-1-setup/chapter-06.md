# Chapter 06: The Door That Opened

The doorhandle is cold and far away, like it belongs to someone else.

Mara's hand closes around it anyway. Her fingers feel thick, lagging behind her intention. The hallway light slices under the door, a pale ribbon. Hannah's voice is on the other side, urgent and close. "Mara, open the door. Now." The words sound like they're traveling through water.

She turns the handle. The latch sticks, then gives. The door swings open and the hallway rushes in: a wash of warmer air, footsteps, the smell of bleach and old coffee. Hannah is right there, her face pale in the dim light, one hand braced on the frame.

"Jesus," Hannah says. She is always calm, and the break in that calm feels like a siren. "Your eyes look... wrong." She reaches for Mara's arm, her grip firm.

Mara tries to say something breezy. "Good morning," she manages, and it comes out thin, a thread of sound. Her head swims. The room behind her is quiet and too warm, the fan silent, the heater off. The open window is a dark rectangle at the far wall, a mouth she can't reach.

Hannah pushes past her and flings the window wider. Cold air floods in. It slaps Mara's face and she inhales like she's been holding her breath for hours. The relief is sharp and then dissolves, like a pill that melts on the tongue without doing its job.

"You didn't answer my texts," Hannah says. "I knocked. You didn't move. I thought you were..." She doesn't finish. She pulls Mara toward the hallway.

Mara takes one step and the floor moves sideways. She grabs the doorframe. Her palm slips on the paint. Her mouth tastes like pennies and heat.

"You're going downstairs," Hannah says. "Now." It isn't a suggestion. Mara is too heavy to argue.

They move in a slow, careful shuffle. The hallway is warm, but not enough to be comforting. The heaters in the corridor tick, small and patient. The air has that faint sweet smell that has become too familiar, like burnt sugar, like a warning you can taste.

At the top of the stairs, the receptionist appears, drawn by the noise. He looks at Mara and then at Hannah, his expression blank. "Again?" he says, as if she has forgotten to sign a form.

"She's not okay," Hannah says. "She needs a doctor. Now." Her voice has a hard edge.

The receptionist shrugs. "Altitude," he says, as if it is a spell that fixes everything. "Drink water. Rest." He gestures toward the common room with his coffee cup.

Mara wants to tell him that altitude doesn't smell like metal. She wants to tell him her room feels like it is trying to take something from her. She doesn't say anything. The words are heavy, and her tongue is lazy.

Hannah gives him a look that could cut glass. "Fine," she says. "We'll handle it." She hooks Mara's arm over her shoulder and guides her down the stairs.

The common room is loud and bright. It feels too far away from the quiet panic upstairs. Mara sits on the couch and leans forward, elbows on her knees. The room sways gently. Someone laughs at the long table. A blender whines in the kitchen. A fan on the wall rotates with a bored squeak.

The compass-tattoo guy is on the opposite couch, a blanket over his knees and a cup of coca tea in his hands. His face is gray. He catches Mara looking and gives a small, tired nod. A mirror of her own condition.

Hannah pushes a mug of tea into Mara's hands. "Drink," she says. "And breathe. Do not close your eyes."

Mara sips. The tea tastes like grass and duty. She tries to focus on the steam, on the warmth in her fingers. Her phone buzzes in her pocket. She doesn't check it.

The receptionist passes through, headed to the kitchen. He pauses at the doorway. "If you close the window, you will feel bad," he says, like a lecture. "Open window. No heater with window closed." He says it like a man who is tired of repeating himself.

"Then stop telling people to close their windows," Hannah says under her breath. The receptionist doesn't hear her or pretends not to.

Mara's vision clears enough to see the common room for what it is: a low ceiling, damp walls, the smell of detergent and oil. The air isn't fresh, but it's better than her room. She takes a deeper breath and feels the headache slide a notch higher.

"You're going to a clinic," Hannah says. "Right now."

"I don't need a clinic," Mara says. She tries for stubbornness and hears a whisper. "I'm just tired."

"You're past tired," Hannah says. "You were barely standing. You are not dying in that room because a man with a shrug says it's altitude."

Mara wants to argue. She wants to maintain control. She wants to be the one making decisions about her own body. But she is already here, and Hannah is already standing with her bag and her jacket, ready to go. Mara takes a breath and nods. The nod feels like a surrender.

---

The clinic is two streets away and smells like bleach and wet coats.

A nurse in pink scrubs ushers them into a small room with a plastic chair and a poster of lungs on the wall. The poster shows bright, healthy lungs. Mara feels offended by them. She sits while the nurse wraps a cuff around her arm and clicks a thermometer into place. Hannah hovers, arms crossed, the unofficial keeper of the space.

"Headache, dizziness, nausea?" the nurse asks in Spanish. Hannah translates, or tries to. Mara nods to everything because it's all true and none of it seems enough.

A doctor arrives, young and tired, his hair flattened by the hat he carries in his hand. He speaks English in short, careful sentences. "Altitude is possible," he says. "But you say you feel worse in your room and better outside?" He looks at her, waiting.

"Yes," Mara says. The word is easy.

"Your room has a heater? Gas?" he asks.

"Yes," she says, and the word is heavier.

He nods. "It could be carbon monoxide exposure. Symptoms can be headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion. It can make you pass out. It can kill. It looks like altitude because the body is starved of oxygen. The air is not the problem. The oxygen is.")

Mara laughs, a single nervous puff of air. It sounds wrong in the small room. She glances at Hannah, who is not laughing at all.

"We can give oxygen," the doctor says. "You should not sleep in that room with a heater. Keep windows open. Do not use heater if the room is closed. If you feel dizzy again, come back. If you faint, you must come back." He pauses. "You should consider moving rooms or hotels."

The word move feels like an expense, a logistical knot, a failure. Mara nods anyway. The nurse fits a clear mask over her face and turns on the oxygen. Cool air floods in. It tastes like nothing and makes her want to cry. Her head softens, the pressure easing as if someone loosens a belt around her skull.

She sits for twenty minutes with the mask on. The world steadies. The nurse checks her vitals again. The numbers are fine enough to send her away.

"Can I buy a detector?" Mara asks as they leave. She doesn't care if it sounds dramatic anymore.

The doctor shakes his head. "Not easy here. They sell smoke detectors, not CO. You can buy online. But you are not online. You are here." He shrugs, a gentler version of the receptionist's shrug. "Best is fresh air. No heater."

Mara pulls the mask off and breathes the clinic air. It is stale but clean. It doesn't smell like metal.

Outside, the street is wet with a recent rain. The buses hiss. The vendors call. The city continues like it doesn't care about her near-miss. Hannah buys her a bottle of water from a kiosk and presses it into her hand. "Drink," she says, as if hydration can erase all of this.

"Are you okay?" Hannah asks as they walk back.

"I feel stupid," Mara says. "Like I ignored something obvious because it didn't fit my plans."

Hannah glances at her. "That's not stupid. That's human. Also, your plans are not worth dying for, in case you were wondering." She tries for lightness. It lands, but the line sticks.

They pass a hardware store with fans in the window. The same ones as yesterday, cheap and cheerful. Mara stops and peers inside. No detectors. Just locks and pipes and rolls of aluminum tape. The tape sits there in a stack like a quiet accusation.

Back at the hostel, the receptionist looks up when they enter. "You go doctor?" he asks, as if verifying a reservation.

"Yes," Hannah says. "He said it could be carbon monoxide."

The receptionist shrugs. "Altitude," he says again, and this time Mara wants to scream. Instead, she says, "He said not to use the heater in a closed room."

"Open window," the receptionist replies. He gestures at a laminated sign as if it is law. "Open window, no problem."

"And when you tell us to close the window for security?" Mara asks. Her voice is sharper than she intended. It cuts through the buzz of the lobby.

He looks at her for a moment. "You choose," he says, the same line as before. "Security or air."

Mara doesn't have a comeback that fits in two words. She takes the room key and walks away. Hannah stays a beat longer, her face tight, then follows.

In the hallway, the heat is already rising. The heaters are on. The faint sweetness is back, and now it feels like a known threat. Mara touches the wall. It is warm. She looks up at the vent above her door. The aluminum tape shines, smooth and sealed. It looks like someone bandaged a wound and then kept pressing.

She opens her room and lets the cooler air rush out. The window is still open, the stool wedged against it. The fan sits on the desk, its blades still. She turns it on and it whirs to life, pushing air toward the open window. The movement makes her feel a fraction better, like the room is breathing in the right direction.

"You should move rooms," Hannah says, standing in the doorway.

"They don't have any," Mara says.

"You should move hostels," Hannah says.

Mara looks around her tiny room: the bed, the desk, the camera gear, the editing hard drive, the backpack she has unpacked like a claim. She thinks about finding another place, hauling all of this down the stairs, the cost of last-minute nights, the reviews. She thinks about the spreadsheet in her head, the thin margin she lives in. She thinks about her followers, the video she hasn't edited, the story she wants to tell about Quito. It all weighs more than it should.

"I can make it work," she says. It sounds like a promise. It sounds like denial. It is both.

Hannah studies her. "Okay," she says finally. "But not with the heater on. And the window stays open. If it closes, you sleep downstairs. Deal?"

"Deal," Mara says. She means it in the way a tired person means anything: for now.

---

By afternoon, the oxygen high has faded, leaving her with a thin layer of clear-headedness that feels fragile.

She sits in the courtyard with her laptop, the fan at her feet blowing at her ankles. The air outside is damp and real. She can hear the city through the wall, a low hum of traffic and distant voices. Her headache is a dull echo now, not the full drum. She edits footage with more patience than she has felt in days. She trims her own face, bright and smiling, and wonders how often she has lied with her eyes.

Her phone buzzes. A text from her mom: "How are you feeling?" Mara types, "Much better. Doctor said it's altitude," and stares at the message. It is a half-truth with good intentions. She sends it anyway. Her mother's heart doesn't need more burden.

A message from the blank account appears under it: "CO will not announce itself. Open window does not fix if the vent is sealed." The words make her stomach twist. She looks up at the second-floor windows. She thinks about the tape. She thinks about the maintenance guy smoothing it down.

She considers replying. She doesn't. She puts the phone face down and listens to the fan whir, the small sound of something trying to keep her alive.

In the common room, a new group arrives, backpacks thumping, faces bright with the confidence of Day One. They laugh at the map wall. They ask for towel tokens. Mara watches them with a strange tenderness. She wants to warn them and also doesn't want to be the paranoid woman in the courtyard. She feels the weight of knowledge and the weight of being seen.

The compass-tattoo guy sits at the long table, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders. His eyes are clearer now, his skin less gray. He nods at Mara when he sees her. "You go to doctor?" he asks.

"Yeah," she says.

"Me too," he says. "They gave me oxygen. Said no heater. Like we didn't already know." He snorts. "I asked for another room. They said no. So I opened my window and bought a beanie." He holds up a knit cap as proof.

"Maybe we should build a fort in the common room," Mara says.

"A fort with fresh air," he says. The humor is dark, a shared currency.

A staff member wheels a cart of linens past them. The cleaner is with her, her eyes still red. She pauses at the stairwell and looks up, then down, then at Mara. She says something in Spanish, a sentence of soft consonants. Mara catches only one word: "peligro." Danger. The cleaner crosses herself quickly and moves on. Mara's chest tightens.

She goes to reception, not because she wants another shrug, but because she wants to see if she can make herself brave. The manager in the sweater vest is there today, his clipboard in hand. He smiles without teeth.

"Hello," Mara says. "The doctor said the heater in my room is dangerous. He said carbon monoxide." She says the words clearly, to see if they sound real.

The manager's smile fades. "We have had heaters for years," he says, in English that is formal and stiff. "We tell guests to open the window. We have signs. It is safe if used correctly."

"The vent is taped," she says, pointing up the hallway.

"Maintenance," he says. "The building is old. We seal leaks."

"You sealed ventilation," she says. Her voice is steady. She is surprised by that.

He sighs, as if she is an inconvenience. "Do you want another blanket?" he asks. The question is a small weapon.

Mara feels the anger rise and then flatten under the weight of exhaustion. "I want a room that doesn't try to kill me," she says, and her voice shakes on the last word.

The manager looks at her for a long moment. "We are full," he says. "If you are not comfortable, you are welcome to check out." He says it politely, like an option, like a door that opens onto the street.

Mara nods. She thanks him because she doesn't know what else to do. The door is open. She doesn't walk through it. Instead, she goes upstairs with her blanket and her fan and her fear and decides, again, to make it work.

By late afternoon, the oxygen has worn off and the headache has found its way back like a relative who claims the guest bed.

She sits at her desk with the fan pointed at the window and opens her notes app. She makes a list that feels like a spell and a contract. OPEN WINDOW. NO HEATER. TEXT HANNAH. SLEEP LIGHT. She stares at it until the words blur, then saves it like it will save her.

She goes to the kitchen because hunger is easier than fear. The room is humid and loud, the air thick with garlic and detergent. A laminated checklist hangs above the stove: TURN OFF HEATERS. OPEN WINDOWS. The English is slightly off, but the meaning is clear. Someone has drawn a smiley face at the bottom. Its mouth has been smudged into a frown.

The maintenance guy is at the sink rinsing a wrench. She clears her throat. "Why tape the vents?" she asks, keeping her voice casual.

He looks at her, then at the ceiling, then at his wrench. "Cold," he says. He makes a shiver motion with his shoulders. "Too cold. Tape. Warm."

"And the air?" she asks.

He shrugs. "Old building." He wipes his hands on his pants and walks out. The answer is a door that closes.

She pours hot water into a mug and drops a tea bag in, the same coca tea the clinic sold her. It tastes like dirt and comfort. She sits at the table and watches the common room through the doorway. A new group is playing cards, already loud. Someone is tuning a guitar. The hostel is a machine that keeps moving no matter who is sick in which room.

Her phone buzzes. A DM from a follower: "My cousin died from CO in a motel. Please take this seriously." The words are blunt, as if typed with shaking hands. Mara stares at them. She wants to reply with gratitude, with reassurance, with a promise. She types, "Thank you. I'm being careful," and sends it. It is true and also not enough.

She goes upstairs to grab a hoodie and passes the stairwell landing. The skull doodle is there, and someone has added a speech bubble: "BREATHE DEEP." The humor feels cruel now, like a joke aimed at her. She touches the wall with her fingertips and the paint feels gritty.

In her room, she opens the window wider. The rain has stopped and the air outside smells like wet stone. She aims the fan toward the gap, as if she can coax the room to exhale. It helps a little. She puts her palm in front of the blades and feels the thin stream of air. It is almost nothing. She keeps it on anyway.

She considers moving her things to the dorm. She opens her closet, which is really just two hooks, and looks at her backpack. The idea of hauling it down the hall feels like a confession. She wants to be the capable one. She wants to be in control. She wants to not be the person who makes a scene. The wants are all tangled.

She goes downstairs again because her room feels too quiet. In the common room, Hannah is lacing her boots. "I'm going out for a bit," Hannah says. "If you want a drink, come. Fresh air, open door."

Mara hesitates. The thought of a bar full of bodies and loud music doesn't appeal. The thought of going upstairs to be alone with the heater does even less. "One drink," she says.

They walk into the damp street. The city is slick with rain, headlights reflected in the puddles. The bar they pick has an open front, the kind that lets the air move. The music is low, a thrum that you can feel in your ribs. Mara orders a beer and holds it without drinking for a moment, letting the cool glass ground her.

"You really should move," Hannah says, not unkind.

"I know," Mara says. She takes a sip. The beer tastes like metal and hops, the metal making her think of the heater and the clinic and the mask. She shakes her head. "I don't want to lose money. I don't want to look dramatic. I don't want to have to explain it on camera." She hears herself say it and hates how small it sounds.

"So don't explain it on camera," Hannah says. "You don't owe anyone an on-camera death."

Mara laughs, a short, real laugh that breaks the tension. "That's a low bar," she says.

"We're in a bar," Hannah says.

They sit for thirty minutes. The air is cool and honest. Mara's head clears a little. She forgets the heater for a handful of minutes, which feels like a gift. When they walk back, the hostel's light is a yellow smear in the rain, the doorway a square of warmth.

At the foot of the stairs, Mara stops. She can feel the heat rising from above like a smell. "If I feel weird, I'll come down," she says.

"If I don't hear from you by ten, I'm knocking," Hannah says. It is a joke in a jacket. Mara nods.

She climbs the stairs alone, the hallway warming as she goes. The taped vents catch the light. The air tastes faintly sweet. She opens her door and lets the cooler air spill out. The fan hums in the corner. The list on her phone waits on the screen, a small set of rules in a room that keeps bending them.

---

By night, the hostel is damp with laughter and the smell of beer.

Mara sits on her bed with the heater off, the fan on, the window propped open with the stool and the water bottle, both braced against the frame like small guardians. The cold is a real, physical thing. It sits in the room and crawls into her knees. She wears two sweaters and still shivers.

She could turn the heater on low, just for a little while. She could get warm, then turn it off. She could be careful. She repeats the thought like a metronome. She does not do it. Not yet.

She opens her laptop and tries to edit. The footage from the cable car is bright and beautiful. She adds a caption about the view and how the air is different up there. She almost types, "It makes you feel alive," and then deletes it because it feels too pointed. She settles for, "Worth the altitude headache," and adds a mountain emoji. Her followers will laugh. The line will be true and not true at once.

The fan hums. The window breathes. The hostel's night sounds creep in: a door closing, a laugh, a toilet flush. She is tired in the way that feels like she will never be fully rested again.

Her phone buzzes. Hannah: "You alive?" Mara replies, "Yes. Window open. No heater. Cold as a corpse."

Hannah: "Good. Stay cold."

Mara smiles despite herself. The dark humor is a small hand in the dark.

She pulls the extra blanket around her and lies down with the fan still running. The air on her face is cold and thin. She closes her eyes and tells herself the cold is safer. She tells herself she can sleep like this. The room does not believe her.

An hour later, she wakes with her teeth chattering. Her hands are stiff. The fan is still on, but its breeze is now just a cold whisper. The rain has started again, tapping the window like fingernails. She sits up and rubs her arms. The heater is in the corner, silent, looking like an insult.

She thinks of the clinic. Of the doctor saying carbon monoxide. Of Hannah's face. Of the blank account's message about the taped vent. She thinks of the compass-tattoo guy and his beanie. She thinks of the manager's polite threat. She thinks of the cold as a cost she can afford, and of the warmth as a cost she can't.

She stands, crosses the room, and puts her hand on the heater's switch. It is a small, ordinary action with an enormous shadow.

"Just for ten minutes," she says out loud, because saying it makes it feel like a rule. She flips the switch.

The flame catches with a soft whoosh. The heater ticks. The room exhales warmth. The sweet smell threads through the air almost immediately, faint at first, then a little stronger. The fan pushes it away, or tries to. The window is open. The stool holds. The water bottle stands guard.

Mara sits on the bed and waits for the warmth to take the edge off the cold. It does. Her shoulders drop. Her breath smooths. The relief is physical and immediate, and that is what scares her. She watches the window, the rain, the dark. She sets a timer on her phone for ten minutes. When it buzzes, she turns the heater off. She does it. She is proud of herself.

She lies back down. The room cools again. The fan hums. The window stays open. She is cold, but she is also safe, she tells herself. She repeats it until it becomes a lullaby.

In the hallway, someone laughs and then coughs, a wet sound that goes on too long. A door opens and closes. The hostel sighs. The fan's small hum fades as her body goes slack.

She drifts. The cold becomes a blanket. The room fades.

At some point in the night, the power flickers. The fan stops and starts, then stops. The heater, already off, stays off. The stool against the window shifts with a small scrape as the wind changes direction. The window slides an inch toward closed. The water bottle wobbles and holds.

Mara dreams of air that is too thin to hold her. In the dream, she reaches for the surface and her hands move through it like fog.

She wakes to a soft beeping somewhere in the hallway. Not an alarm, not quite. A chirp that repeats. It could be a phone. It could be a detector. It could be nothing at all. She lies still, listening, her breath shallow. The sound stops. The hallway goes quiet again.

She should get up and check. She doesn't. The cold has pinned her. The tiredness is a weight.

She closes her eyes. The fan is still silent. The air feels thicker than it should. The window is still cracked, but the crack feels smaller now, the night more sealed.

Her phone vibrates against the nightstand. A new message from the blank account. It is just three words: "Not tonight."

Mara stares at the screen until it goes dark. Then she turns onto her side, away from the heater, and listens to the room breathe.
