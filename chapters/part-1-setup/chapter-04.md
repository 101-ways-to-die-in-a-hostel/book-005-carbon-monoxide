# Chapter 04: Oxygen Debt

Mara comes back to herself in pieces: the smell of hot metal, the slap of air on her face, the sound of someone saying her name like a warning.

She is on her back. The ceiling is a low, yellow rectangle. The light is too bright and not bright enough. The room is full of cold now, as if someone opened a freezer door. She tries to breathe and the breath catches halfway, then slips in, thin and stuttering. Her head feels packed with wet sand.

Someone is at her shoulder. Hannah, hovering like a reluctant angel. The receptionist stands near the window, his arms crossed, his face unreadable. The window is flung open, the curtain whipping like a flag. The heater is off, its blue eye dead. The floor tiles under her are shockingly cold, a reality check against her cheek.

"Mara," Hannah says again. "Hey. Come on. You with me?"

Mara blinks. It feels like blinking through syrup. "I'm here," she says, which sounds wrong, like she's reading someone else's line. Her tongue tastes like a battery. She tries to sit and the room reels, so she lies still and lets the ceiling settle.

The receptionist sighs, a sound that could be concern if he wanted it to be. "You locked the window," he says. Not a question.

"I didn't," Mara says. "The wind..."

"Night, you must open," he says, half to her, half to the room. "No heater with window closed." He says it like a rule, like the sticker she didn't read fast enough, like this is her fault for not obeying it. He doesn't mention that he told her to keep it shut for security. He doesn't mention the note. He doesn't mention the dead detector at the front desk.

Hannah gives the receptionist a look. "She was out," she says. "Out, out. You should call a doctor."

"Doctor is far," he says, the same line as before, the same shrug. "Altitude. She sleep too much." He looks at Mara as if she can confirm this. She doesn't. Her throat is dry. Her head hurts.

Mara grips the edge of the bed and forces herself up. The mattress squeaks like it's telling on her. The room tilts, then steadies. She keeps her eyes on the open window, the gray light, the rain-slicked laundry wall. The air outside is damp and clean. It smells like the street, like wet stone and exhaust, and it feels like a rescue.

"I'm fine," she says, because she is not going to a hospital in a foreign city for something she can blame on altitude. She is not calling her mother with that story. She is not missing a day of work. She has a video to edit. She has a channel to keep alive. She has pride, which is its own kind of poison.

Hannah holds her elbow. "You're not fine."

"I'm okay," Mara says, a softer lie.

The receptionist opens the door, more for himself than for her. "Breakfast downstairs," he says. "You need eat. You need air." He pauses, then adds, "Do not close window."

"The note said to keep it closed," Mara says, and the edge in her voice surprises her. She pulls the paper out of her pocket, the polite threat. She holds it up.

He glances at it as if it's the first time he's seen it. "Security," he says. "You want security, close. You want air, open. You choose." He says it like a joke. He walks out.

Hannah watches him go. "That's not how safety works," she mutters.

Mara swings her legs to the floor and stands. The tile is cold, grounding. The air feels better, but the headache stays, a tight crown. She takes a breath and feels a thin relief, like a cough after a cold. She is awake now, in a way she wasn't ten minutes ago.

"What time is it?" she asks.

"Almost ten," Hannah says. "I knocked at nine. You didn't answer. I asked for a key." She says it like a confession, like she might have crossed a line. "I was worried."

Mara doesn't know how to say thank you without making it bigger, so she says, "I'm sorry," which feels more honest and less helpful.

They go downstairs together, slowly. The hallway is colder now, the heaters off, the sweetness gone. The change is almost a relief. Mara keeps her hand on the rail. She notices a small soot streak on the wall near the ceiling, a smudge like a thumbprint. It hadn't been there yesterday, or maybe she hadn't been looking.

In the common room, the morning is loud and ordinary. The coffee smells like burnt beans. Someone is frying garlic in the kitchen. A backpack thumps against a chair. The normalcy feels obscene, like a party thrown in a hospital hallway.

Mara sits on the couch and lets her head tilt back. The ceiling lights hum. She closes her eyes for a second and sees the heater flame, blue and patient. She opens them again. She is not ready to be alone with her own head.

Hannah pushes a mug of tea into her hands. "Drink," she says, as if it will fix the oxygen in her blood.

Mara drinks anyway. The tea tastes like grass. She would normally complain. Today she doesn't have the energy.

"You scared me," Hannah says, a low voice so the room won't hear.

"I scared me," Mara says. She tries to smile. It comes out thin.

Across the room, the receptionist leans against the kitchen door, talking to the cleaner. The cleaner's eyes are red, like yesterday. She points up toward the stairs and says something in Spanish. He shakes his head. He shrugs. The shrug is his most active gesture. The cleaner wipes her hands on her apron and walks away, her shoulders tight.

Mara watches the exchange, trying to catch words. She hears "calor" and "ventana" and something that sounds like "malo." She doesn't need a translation. Heat. Window. Bad.

She reaches for her phone, not to text, but to ground herself. There are new messages. Hannah's texts from earlier. A DM from the blank account: "That hostel has leaks. Don't sleep with the heater." No emoji, no punctuation, just a fact in a monotone voice. Under it, a new message from someone with a real profile picture: "Girl, please take this seriously. CO poisoning sneaks up."

She scrolls past them, then scrolls back. She hasn't told anyone about the note or the closed window or the receptionist. People she has never met are warning her about the thing she is pretending isn't real. It feels invasive, like someone peeking through a keyhole.

She types a reply to the real-looking account: "Thanks, I know. Just altitude stuff." She deletes it. She leaves the message unanswered.

"Maybe you should go to a clinic," Hannah says.

"I'm okay," Mara says again. "Just tired. Maybe dehydrated." She lifts her water bottle as evidence.

Hannah studies her face. "You look gray."

"That's my brand," Mara says. It's supposed to be a joke. It lands like one. The humor buys her a few seconds of not being interrogated.

She doesn't go to a clinic. She doesn't go to a hospital. She goes to the courtyard instead, because she can see the sky there and it feels like something she can control.

---

The courtyard at midday is a damp bowl of light. The string lights are off, the hammock empty, the plants wet and shining. Mara sits at the small table with her laptop and a second cup of tea. The air outside is clean enough to make her chest ache. She takes shallow breaths without meaning to, as if she is trying not to waste it.

She opens her editing software and stares at the timeline. The clips from the basilica and the market sit there like unopened letters. She can't make herself care. The footage feels far away, like it belongs to someone else. She scrolls through her feed instead, looking for something that will make her feel like she exists.

A new comment on her last post reads, "You should get a CO detector. They sell them on Amazon cheap." She almost laughs. Amazon feels like a different planet when you're in a courtyard in Quito with wet shoes and a headache. The advice is reasonable and useless at the same time.

The hostel manager walks through the courtyard with a clipboard. He is a thin man with a moustache and a sweater vest, a version of authority that feels borrowed. He nods at Mara without really seeing her. He goes into the kitchen and comes out a few minutes later with the receptionist. They talk with their heads close. The manager points up toward the upper floors. The receptionist shrugs. The manager's mouth tightens. He disappears back inside.

Mara watches the scene like it's a television show she can't turn off. She decides this is a day of not being alone. She goes to find Hannah.

Hannah is in the common room, flipping through a guidebook with the air of someone who enjoys order. "There you are," she says. "I was about to send a search party." Her tone is light. Her eyes are not.

"I was outside," Mara says. "Breathing." She expects it to sound dramatic. It doesn't. It sounds simple.

Hannah closes the guidebook. "Let's get you some medicine. Altitude meds, oxygen can, something." She says it with the briskness of someone who decides for other people because it makes her feel useful. Mara doesn't argue. The thought of the street air is a relief.

They walk to a pharmacy two blocks away. The street is wet and bright, vendors ducking under tarps, buses hissing to a stop. The air smells like fried dough and diesel. It is the kind of dirty air that still feels better than a closed room.

The pharmacy is small and crowded. Shelves stacked with boxes in bright colors, a little shrine of aspirin and herbal remedies. A young pharmacist in a white coat looks at Mara and says, "Altitude?" as if it's the only thing that could make her look like this. Mara nods because it's easier.

He pulls out a box of coca tea and a packet of pills. He also offers a small blue can labeled O2, a tourist gimmick with mountains on it. Hannah buys it without asking. The can is cool and heavy in Mara's hand, a prop that promises relief.

"Is there a carbon monoxide detector?" Hannah asks, not even looking at Mara.

The pharmacist blinks. "Detector?" He shakes his head. "No. For cars?"

"For heaters," Hannah says. "Like, for rooms."

He spreads his hands. "No. Maybe ferreteria," he says, hardware store, and shrugs in a way that feels familiar.

Mara puts the O2 can in her bag. It clinks against her camera lens, a small irony. She buys the coca tea because it's the ritual. She buys the pills because it feels like doing something. She does not buy a detector because there isn't one, because the city isn't set up for her fear.

On the walk back, she tries the oxygen can. You press it to your mouth and inhale, a hiss of manufactured freshness. The air tastes like nothing, which is the point. It gives her a small, almost embarrassing rush. She laughs. "I can't believe I just inhaled canned air," she says.

"You're an influencer," Hannah says. "You'd inhale canned air if it was branded."

"Only if it was sponsored," Mara says. It is a joke and a truth.

They pass a hardware store with a stack of gas canisters and metal pipes in the window. Mara slows, peering in. There are fans, screws, locks, lightbulbs. No detectors. She doesn't go inside. She doesn't want to be the weird foreigner asking for something the store probably doesn't have. She is tired of being that person today.

Back at the hostel, she drops onto the couch. The common room is quieter, the post-lunch lull. A German guy is watching a soccer match on his phone, the announcer shouting tinny goals. Someone is snoring in the corner. The air is warm, but not as oppressive as the hallway.

Mara opens the O2 can again and takes another hit, just to see. It makes her feel ridiculous and slightly better, like cold water on a hot day. She holds the can up and snaps a photo. It could be content: "Travel hack!" She deletes it. She cannot bring herself to make this into a joke yet.

Hannah watches her. "Maybe you should switch rooms," she says.

Mara imagines packing her bag, dragging her camera gear down the hall, explaining to the receptionist that she doesn't feel safe. She imagines his shrug. She imagines the extra cost. She imagines the embarrassment of making a fuss and then still having to sleep somewhere. She imagines the algorithm waiting for her to post something new.

"They're probably full," she says.

"Did you ask?"

"Not yet." It feels like a confession.

Hannah sighs. "Do it anyway."

Mara nods and does not move. She is a person of movement and lists and plans. Today she is heavy. She decides to wait until later, until she has more energy to argue. She doesn't know that later is where bad decisions live.

In the afternoon, the rain stops and the sun comes out like it was never gone. The courtyard dries in patches. People reappear with beers. The bar crawl group from last night shows photos of themselves in hats. Luis plays guitar in the corner, badly, and everyone forgives him because it's a hostel.

Mara should film something. She should be the person with the camera. She isn't. She sits in the sun and lets it warm her skin in a way the heater never did. The warmth feels safe. It feels earned. She closes her eyes and listens to the hostel's noises: the clink of bottles, the slap of sandals, the distant honk of traffic. It is ordinary and therefore comforting.

Her phone buzzes. A text from her mom. "Checking in. Feeling better?" Mara replies with a thumbs up and a heart. She doesn't mention the floor, the unconsciousness, the heater. She doesn't mention that the air tastes like pennies. She chooses the smallest truth she can live with.

Another message arrives. It's from the blank account again. "They'll tell you it's altitude. It isn't." The line sits there like a dare. She stares at it until the screen dims. She doesn't reply.

A staff member appears at the top of the stairs, a man in a gray jumpsuit with a toolbox. He looks around, then disappears down the hallway. Mara sits up. She watches him for a while. She can hear faint banging above, a metal-on-metal sound, and then the sound of tape tearing. She imagines him pressing aluminum tape over vents, smoothing it down, like the patch on her wall.

Hannah comes out of the kitchen with a plate of plantains. "Eat," she says, as if feeding Mara will fix the air. Mara eats one. It is sweet and hot and makes her feel almost normal for five minutes.

She decides to go to reception. She stands, feeling a small wobble, and walks to the desk. The receptionist looks up, bored, and says, "Yes?"

"Is there another room available?" she asks. She hears her voice, higher than usual.

He checks a ledger with a thumb stained with ink. "No," he says, without looking. "Full." He taps the page for emphasis. "Many people. Weekend."

"My heater..." she starts.

He cuts her off with a familiar shrug. "Heater is fine. Open window. If too cold, extra blanket." He gestures toward a shelf of folded wool. The gesture is automatic, like muscle memory.

"It's not cold," Mara says. "It's..." She doesn't finish. She doesn't have a word that will make him understand that the air feels wrong.

He picks up his coffee and takes a sip. "We can send maintenance," he says, as if offering a consolation prize. "But heater is old, like everything. It works." He smiles, an apology disguised as a joke.

Mara nods because there is nothing else to do. She takes another blanket and carries it upstairs like a shield.

She doesn't go straight to her room. She turns toward the stairs to the roof instead, following the instinct that fresh air is the only medicine she trusts. The stairwell smells of bleach and damp. Halfway up, she sees the maintenance guy again, crouched by a vent, the gray jumpsuit pulled tight across his shoulders. He has a roll of aluminum tape in one hand and a screwdriver in the other.

"Todo bien?" he asks, without looking up.

"Si," Mara says, because that's the simplest answer she has, and she keeps climbing. The tape's metallic rip follows her like a zipper. She glances back once and sees him smoothing the tape along the vent, sealing it with the care of a person wrapping a gift he doesn't like.

The roof is empty. The yoga mats are gone. The sky is a clean, washed blue that makes the mountains look like bruises in the distance. She stands at the edge and takes a deep breath of the thin air, letting it ache her lungs. It is cold enough to make her eyes water. It is also clear enough to make her feel like a person again.

She sits on the low wall and takes out the O2 can, the absurd little thing. She gives herself another hiss of nothing, mostly for the theater of it. The can chills her lips. The air beyond the roof tastes of rain and dust and exhaust, and it feels like a cure she doesn't have to pay for.

Luis comes up a few minutes later, a plastic bag of bread in his hand, a grin on his face. "You skipping the daytime fun?" he asks.

"Taking my vitamins," Mara says, tapping the O2 can. She makes it a joke before it can become a confession.

Luis laughs. "Quito sells air now? Capitalism really gets everywhere." He tears off a piece of bread and offers it to her. She takes it. It's soft and a little sweet. She eats it because it is there.

"You okay?" he asks, his tone shifting.

"Yeah. Altitude. You know." The line is old. It still works.

"Altitude sucks," he says. "In La Paz I got sick. Headache, nausea. My friend had worse. He slept with a heater on in a hostel. Woke up with a nosebleed and vomited everywhere. They told him it was the altitude too. He went to a hospital and they put him on oxygen. He said he felt stupid." Luis shrugs. "Maybe he was. But he was alive."

The word alive hangs in the air between them like a dare. Mara chews her bread slowly. The crust cracks between her teeth. She nods once, because she doesn't know what else to do with the story.

"You should open your window," Luis says, practical, casual, like he's recommending a restaurant. "Security is a joke anyway. The thieves take your phone in the common room, not through the window."

"They told me to keep it shut," Mara says.

He makes a face. "They tell you a lot. They told me the hot water was reliable." He lifts the bread bag to show her the stale roll. "Promises."

She laughs, a short sound that feels like it belongs to someone else. Luis waves and heads back down the stairs, leaving her alone with the mountains and the thin air and the O2 canister, which now feels like a prop for a skit that isn't funny.

She stays on the roof longer than she should, letting the cold make her cheeks sting. When she finally goes back down, she passes the maintenance guy again. He is packing up, tape roll tucked into his pocket. The vent is now wrapped tight, its edges sealed. He nods at her, a tired dip of the chin, and Mara feels a small chill that has nothing to do with the weather.

---

By night, the hostel smells like wet wool and cooking oil. The bar crawl returns in a loud wave, laughter spilling into the courtyard. The common room fills with clinking bottles and stories that get bigger as they are told. Mara sits at the edge of it for a while, a presence without a pulse. The O2 can sits in her bag, a talisman.

She does a half-hearted edit on her laptop, cutting together footage from the basilica with a bright soundtrack. She adds captions. The work is mechanical. She posts it because that is what she does. The likes appear almost immediately, little red hearts that do not require oxygen.

Hannah plops down beside her, cheeks flushed from the night air. "You sure you're okay?" she asks for the third time that day.

"I'm okay," Mara says for the third time. The lie is a worn coin now, smooth from use.

"You should sleep with the window open," Hannah says. "Not a crack. Open." Her voice is firm in a way Mara hasn't heard yet.

"Security," Mara says, and hears the receptionist's shrug in her own mouth.

"Security doesn't help if you don't wake up," Hannah says. It is the closest she has come to bluntness. It lands. Mara's throat tightens.

"I know," Mara says. "I'll keep it open."

Hannah watches her for a moment longer, then nods. "If you want, you can sleep on my dorm floor. There's a spare mat. Less warm, more air." She says it like she's offering a couch, not a shared room full of snoring strangers.

Mara thinks about it. The dorm is loud, chaotic, a place where she would be on display. The private room is where her equipment is, where her stuff is, where she feels in control. The idea of sleeping on the floor feels like admitting defeat. She shakes her head. "I'm fine in my room. I have extra blankets now. I'll keep the window open." She hears the promise in her own voice and hopes it sticks.

"Okay," Hannah says. "Text me in the morning?"

"Sure." Mara smiles. She means it. She also knows she might forget.

She goes upstairs when the laughter starts to feel like a pressure against her skull. The hallway is warm again. The heaters are humming. The sweetness is back in the air, faint but present, like a memory you can't quite place. She passes the taped vent on her wall. The tape is new, smooth, bright, as if someone tried to make it look clean.

Inside her room, the cold hits her first. The damp is back, sitting on the bed and the desk and the floor like a tired animal. She drops the blankets on the bed. The window is open an inch. The rain has stopped; the city air is cool and wet. She pushes the window up farther until it's open by the width of her hand. The latch doesn't catch. She sets her water bottle on the sill as a wedge, a cheap solution that feels clever.

She stares at the heater. The little metal box looks harmless in the dim light. She thinks about the warning sticker, the Spanish words she now knows by heart. She thinks about the receptionist's shrug. She thinks about the O2 can in her bag. She thinks about the camera on the desk, the lens cap off like an open eye.

She turns the heater on.

The flame catches. The ticking begins. The room exhales warmth. The smell arrives, the faint caramel that makes her stomach roll and her knees soften. She opens the window another inch, just to be safe. She tells herself this is a balance, a compromise between cold and caution. She tells herself she is not stupid. She tells herself this is enough.

She takes a quick hit of the oxygen can, because it's there and because the hiss makes her feel in control. The air tastes like nothing and everything. She laughs under her breath at the absurdity of it. Canned air and a gas heater. The humor is dark and real.

She sets the can on the bedside table, a little blue lighthouse. She drinks water. She checks her phone. A text from her mom: "Love you." She replies with a heart. She doesn't mention the canned air.

She climbs into bed, two blankets thick. The warmth soaks into her. The heater ticks. The window breathes. The air feels fine, almost. Her headache is a dull ache, an echo instead of a scream. She can live with echoes. She sets her alarm for 7 a.m. and places her phone face down.

As she closes her eyes, she hears a faint click from the window. The water bottle shifts, nudged by a breeze. It holds for now. She turns onto her side, away from the heater, and lets her body settle.

She tells herself she is safe because she is doing everything right. She tells herself she is safe because she is tired. She tells herself she is safe because she wants to be.

In the hallway, a door opens and closes. The hostel sighs in its sleep. The heater ticks. The room warms. The air thickens in small, invisible degrees.

Mara sleeps, and the can of oxygen on her nightstand stays full.
