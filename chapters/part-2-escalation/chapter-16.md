# Chapter 16: The Hum That Eats

The power goes out and the building starts to breathe.

It is not a dramatic breath. It is a low, steady hum that rises from somewhere under the lobby, a mechanical purr that makes the air feel thick and busy. The emergency bulbs flicker. The green dot on Mara's cheap detector is still blinking, stubborn as a metronome. The hallway is dim and yellow. The rain slaps the windows like it wants to get in.

The hum starts again, deeper this time, as if something heavy has been switched on. It makes the floorboards tremble just enough that Mara feels it through the soles of her socks. She sits up in bed, blanket still around her shoulders, and listens. The sound is familiar in the way of bad news. It sounds like the generators she has seen in markets and construction sites, the ones that cough blue smoke and buzz like angry bees. She tells herself the hostel is probably running a generator to keep the lights on. She tells herself it's a normal thing. She tells herself a dozen normal things while the air tastes like a candle that has been burning too long.

Hannah rolls over and murmurs, "Still out?"

"Yeah," Mara says. "There's a hum. Downstairs." Her voice sounds too loud in the quiet.

"Generator," Hannah says, sleepy. "It's fine." She pulls the blanket over her head. She is already going back to sleep.

Mara looks at the window. It is closed, the edges beaded with cold rain. She thinks about opening it and letting the wet air in. She thinks about the cold and the wet and how the room will smell like damp socks. She thinks about the sweet taste on her tongue and the way her head has been a slow drum for days. She cracks the window anyway.

Cold air crawls in, sharp and clean. It is the closest thing to relief she can get. She leans toward it and breathes deep, then straightens when the air stings her throat. The hum continues. The detector blinks green. She tells herself she is safe and the room does not answer.

A door opens down the hall. Footsteps pad toward the stairs. A voice, low and annoyed, says, "Seriously?" Another door opens. Someone laughs. The building is waking up in the dark, a little annoyed at the inconvenience of reality.

Mara pulls on her hoodie and steps into the hallway. The air is warmer here, the kind of warmth that rises from radiators and crowds. The hum is stronger, coming from downstairs now, a steady push. She follows it.

The stairwell smells faintly of oil. Not the fried dough from the market, not the garlic from the kitchen. This is a sharper, thicker smell, the smell of machines. She holds her breath for a few steps and feels ridiculous, because she is in a hostel stairwell, not a mine.

In the lobby, the emergency bulbs cast a sickly glow over everything. The portable heater by the couch is dark, the wires trailing like dead vines. The receptionist is on his phone, the screen lighting his face from below like a campfire ghost story. He looks up when he sees Mara.

"Power out," he says. "Generator on." He says it like he's offering a weather report.

"Where is it?" Mara asks.

He points toward the back hallway, the one that leads to the laundry and the courtyard. "Patio. We have one for the whole block. It's fine." He shrugs in the universal language of not wanting to talk about it.

Mara walks toward the back hallway, following the hum. The air thickens with each step. The smell turns sharper, a thin ribbon of exhaust in the sweet warmth. She passes the kitchen, its door propped open to vent the steam from someone's midnight noodles. The sign about the gas stove hangs on the wall, the printed smiley face drooping in the dim light.

The back hallway opens into a tiny courtyard under a plastic canopy. Rain has pooled at the edges, and the canopy sags in the middle, catching water in a slow, threatening belly. A generator sits against the wall, black and squat, its engine casing trembling. A thin pipe vents out the back, but the pipe is angled toward the wall, the exhaust curling back in on itself like a lazy ribbon. The air in the courtyard is warm and faintly sweet.

A man in a hoodie stands beside it, tapping at his phone. He doesn't look up. He looks like someone who wants to be anywhere else but is paid to be here.

"Is that safe?" Mara asks, and hates the way her voice sounds like a complaint.

The man looks at her, then at the generator, then back at her. He shrugs. "It's outside," he says. "It's fine." He says it in English like he is offering a fact. The exhaust curls anyway.

"It doesn't feel outside," Mara says. She gestures at the plastic canopy, the enclosed walls. The rain falls in sheets beyond the clear plastic, the world a gray blur. The courtyard is dry and still. The air is trapped here, rebounding off plastic and tile.

He shrugs again, a bigger shrug. "We have to run it. No lights. No hot water." He taps the generator with his foot. The machine hums, uncaring.

Mara wants to argue. She wants to say that running it here is like smoking in a closet. She wants to say that her head is already full of bad air. She wants to say that she is tired of being the only person who says anything. She hears herself say, "Okay," instead, because that's the word she uses when she doesn't want to be the villain.

She steps back into the hallway and the air feels thinner, but the sweetness follows her. It is a ghost on her tongue. She realizes she is holding her breath and lets it out, slow and careful.

In the lobby, a group of backpackers has gathered, phones lit up like fireflies. They are laughing about the blackout, about how it's "authentic." Someone makes a joke about ghost stories. Someone else says the hostel should at least provide candles. The receptionist points to a box of tealights on the counter and says, "Only in common room. Safety." The word safety hangs in the air like a decoration.

Mara watches the candles flicker to life on the low tables. She thinks about fire and oxygen and enclosed spaces. The candles smell faintly of vanilla. The generator hums. The room feels like it is slowly filling with itself.

Hannah comes down the stairs a few minutes later, hair damp from the shower she managed before the power died. She looks at Mara's face and reads it in one glance.

"What?" she asks.

"Generator's in the patio," Mara says. "It's kind of enclosed. It smells like exhaust back there." She keeps her voice calm, as if she is reporting on the weather.

Hannah looks toward the back hallway, then back at Mara. "We can open the front door for a bit," she says. "Let air move." She tries to make it sound simple.

They open the front door and prop it with a chair. Rain blows in immediately, cold and wet, making a small river across the tile. The receptionist frowns but doesn't stop them. The lobby fills with the smell of rain and wet street. The air moves. Mara breathes it in and feels her shoulders drop a fraction.

"It's fine," a man on the couch says. He is reading by phone light, his headlamp band around his forehead like a miner. "Generators are outside. That's the point." He goes back to his book.

Mara nods as if she agrees. She doesn't. She keeps the door open anyway.

The hum continues. The candles burn. The green detector in the lobby blinks patiently, its tiny eye unwavering. The detector on her nightstand is upstairs, useless from here. She thinks about going to get it and putting it by the generator just to see. She thinks about how ridiculous that is, as if she is a vigilante of air. She stays where she is and watches the rain.

The power comes back for a moment. Lights flare. The hum stops. A cheer rises in the lobby, small and sarcastic. Then the lights flicker and die again. The hum returns, louder now, the generator straining. The lobby groans as if the building itself is tired of trying.

Mara checks her phone. Two notifications from her mother, one from Hannah's tour group chat, and one from a blank account. She doesn't open the blank one. She leaves it glowing at the top of her screen like a bite mark.

The power flickers on again and this time it stays. The hum winds down and dies. The air does not instantly clean itself. The candles are blown out and the box is put away. The lobby returns to its normal glow. The receptionist turns the portable heater back on, and the orange grid warms up like a small sun. Mara stares at it and feels the air tighten.

"We should sleep," Hannah says. "We need to get out tomorrow." She says it as a vow, like last night, like every night.

Mara nods. She goes upstairs with the taste of candles on her tongue.

---

She doesn't sleep so much as she keeps falling through thin sheets of it.

She dreams of the generator running under a blanket of plastic, the exhaust curling like ribbon. She dreams of the green light on her detector blinking, blinking, blinking until it becomes a heartbeat that is not hers. She wakes every hour to check the window, the detector, her own chest. The rain keeps falling. The city keeps humming.

At some point in the night, she hears a soft knock on the door. She sits up, heart racing. The knock doesn't come again. She listens. The hallway is quiet. The green light blinks. She tells herself she imagined it. She tells herself she imagines everything now.

When the morning finally comes, it is pale and damp. The rain has slowed to a mist that makes the window look frosted. Mara's mouth tastes like pennies and her head is a dull weight. She feels as if she spent the night holding her breath.

She sits up and sees the detector on the nightstand, its green light still blinking. She presses the test button. It beeps, loud and sharp. Hannah groans and rolls over.

"Sorry," Mara whispers. She doesn't trust the silence without the beep.

Hannah sits up slowly, rubbing her eyes. "Did we lose power again?"

"Not yet," Mara says. "But it's not even seven. We should go to the station early." Her voice is flat from exhaustion. She wants to leave before the city wakes up and decides to keep her again.

They pack in a sleepy, stubborn silence. Mara checks the window, closes it. The room feels warm already, the heater ticking faintly. She looks at the wall heater and imagines the old room's blue flame. She pulls her hoodie on and doesn't look back.

Downstairs, the lobby is full of damp jackets and the smell of coffee. The receptionist is awake, his eyes half-lidded. The portable heater glows. Mara feels a sharp burst of irritation and turns it into a deep breath instead.

"Buses?" she asks.

He shrugs. "Maybe today. Maybe not. Protest still." He gestures at the television with his chin. The news is showing a line of people holding signs on a highway, the camera panning over them like a slow scan of a crowd.

Hannah looks at Mara. "We have to try." Her voice is steady and tired. They both know the pattern now: hope, station, shrug, return. They still walk out the door.

The rain has lifted to a fine mist that makes the city feel like it's hiding. The taxi stand is empty. They walk two blocks to catch a bus to the station instead, because it feels like a more honest struggle. The bus is crowded. The windows are fogged. The air is warm and wet and full of the smells of wet wool and breath. Mara stands by the door, holding her bag to her chest, and counts her breaths in the rhythm of the bus's lurch.

At the station, the line is longer than ever. The air smells of diesel and sweat. The ticket window is open, but the woman behind it looks as tired as yesterday.

"No buses," she says before they can speak. "Maybe tomorrow. Maybe next week." She says it with a soft, apologetic smile that makes it worse.

Hannah squeezes Mara's shoulder. "We can look for a ride share. Or a private van." She is trying to be solutions.

Mara nods and pulls out her phone. The ride apps show no cars. The travel forums show warnings and canceled trips. A new post in the hostel group chat says, "Protest moved to the south road. All buses canceled. Stay calm." Stay calm is a useless instruction when you are trapped.

They sit on a plastic bench and drink vending machine coffee that tastes like burned sugar. Mara's head swims. She watches the flow of people and feels like the building is spinning without her. She thinks about the generator under the canopy, the exhaust curling into the lobby. She thinks about the portable heater and the sealed windows. She thinks about the word exposure and the blood test paper folded in her bag. She thinks about all the times she's told her audience to roll with it, to embrace uncertainty. She wants to punch her old self.

"Let's go back," Hannah says finally. "We'll leave tomorrow. We'll figure out something. It's just one more night." The word just is the sharpest part of the sentence.

Mara closes her eyes for a moment and nods. She doesn't trust her voice anymore.

On the walk back, they pass the old hostel without meaning to. The yellow tape is still there, sagging in the wet. The fan in the transom window is still turning, pushing air out like a reluctant confession. The pile of luggage is gone. The street is emptier now, as if the building has already been erased.

Mara's phone buzzes. A new message from the blank account. She opens it because she is tired of the not knowing.

Don't sleep when the hum starts.

She stops on the sidewalk. The rain is a thin veil. The message sits on her screen like a command. She feels the line between warning and threat blur in her chest.

Hannah looks back. "What?"

Mara shows her the phone. Hannah's jaw tightens. "Block it," she says.

Mara does. The screen confirms it. The words still sit in her head.

Back at the hostel, the power is on. The lobby is warm and bright. The portable heater is on again. People are laughing, planning day trips, shrugging about the protest as if it is a quirky detail of the city. The green detector blinks. The air moves under the ceiling fan, slow and even. Everything looks safe and ordinary, which makes Mara feel like she is the only person who can hear the hum under it.

She goes up to her room and sits on the bed without taking off her shoes. She pulls the cheap detector from her nightstand and holds it in her hands like a small animal. She presses the test button and it beeps, the tiny insistence she has come to rely on. She wonders what it would take for it to scream.

"We should go somewhere else tonight," she says when Hannah comes in. "A hotel. A different hostel. Something with no heaters. No generator. Maybe a taxi to the airport." The words come out in a rush. She hears the desperation in them and hates it.

Hannah sits beside her. "We can look," she says gently. "But it's storming, the roads are blocked, and the airport is hours away. We can at least keep the window open. We can sleep with the fan on. We can go down to the lobby if anything feels weird." She pauses. "We're not trapped, okay? We just have to be careful." Her voice is firm, trying to build a wall of reason between Mara and the air.

Mara nods. The wall feels thin.

They spend the afternoon in the common room, where the air is cooler and the noise of other people helps drown the noise in Mara's head. A group of travelers plays cards. Someone is teaching a German backpacker how to make hot chocolate with powdered milk. The bakery next door sends over a tray of day-old bread, and everyone cheers like it is a gift. Mara eats a roll and tastes only the faint metal under the crust.

She checks her phone for messages and sees a post on the hostel's Wi-Fi portal: POWER OUTAGES EXPECTED TONIGHT. USE COMMON ROOM ONLY. DO NOT USE HEATERS IN ROOMS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION. There is a clip-art smiley face beneath the warning, as if gratitude can sanitize danger.

Mara shows it to Hannah. "So they know," she says.

"Good," Hannah replies. "At least they're telling people." She says it like that should be enough.

Mara watches the green detector on the wall blink. She wonders if it is a CO detector or just smoke. She wonders if anyone knows. She wonders if it matters.

When evening comes, the rain returns in earnest, a steady hiss that makes the city feel enclosed. The lights flicker once, twice, then hold. People in the lobby glance up and then back to their conversations. Mara feels her throat tighten.

She goes upstairs before the power dies, wanting to be in her room with her little detector and her open window. She opens the window a full hand's width despite the rain. It drips onto the sill and darkens the curtain. She doesn't care.

Hannah is in the bathroom, humming. The sound is an anchor.

Mara sits on the bed and scrolls her phone. Another message pops up from another blank account, because there are always more.

Warm rooms are the easiest.

She blocks it without reading it twice. Her hands shake a little. She turns the phone face down and stares at the detector.

The power goes out at nine.

The lights die. The fan stops. The room goes still. The generator hum begins again, deep and steady. The air shifts, the same warm, sweet edge as last night. Mara sits up, heart racing. The detector blinks green. It does not alarm.

She looks at the window, open to the rain. The air is cold on her face. The hum is louder now, closer. She thinks about the patio, the plastic canopy, the exhaust curling into the building. She thinks about the warning message, about not sleeping when the hum starts.

Hannah comes out of the bathroom with a towel around her shoulders. "Power's out," she says, as if it is an observation.

"Generator's on," Mara says. "Do you smell it?"

Hannah sniffs. "I just smell rain." She looks at Mara's face. "You don't have to do this again," she says softly. "We can go downstairs. We can go outside. We can do whatever you need." Her voice is gentle, but there's a tired edge to it.

Mara hates that she needs anything. She hates that the air has turned her into a person who asks.

They go downstairs with their jackets on, moving through the dark hallway lit by emergency bulbs. The lobby is full of people now, drawn down by the blackout like moths. Someone has brought candles, and the room flickers with soft light. The portable heater is off, but the air is still warm, warmed by bodies and the hum of the generator.

Mara stands by the front door and opens it, letting rain blow in. People complain about the cold. Someone says, "Close it, it's freezing." She keeps it open anyway.

The receptionist frowns. "We can't leave it open," he says. "Rain." He makes a shooing motion.

"It's just for a minute," Mara says. "We need fresh air." The word fresh feels like a joke.

"We have fresh air," he says, and gestures to the lobby like it is a sealed jar of safety.

Mara wants to scream. She closes the door because she doesn't want to be thrown out. She stands in the lobby and counts her breaths while the generator hums. The candles burn. The air feels warm and soft, a blanket you can't push away.

She takes her oxygen can from her bag and gives herself a quick hiss. The cold burst makes her chest lift. The people nearby glance at her and then look away. She feels stupid and saved at the same time.

Hannah puts a hand on her shoulder. "We can go outside and walk," she says. "Just until the power comes back. We'll get wet. It's fine." She tries to smile.

Mara nods. They step into the rain.

Outside, the air is cold and real. It makes Mara gasp. It tastes like wet stone and earth. She feels her shoulders drop. She walks faster, then slower, letting the rain soak her hair and hoodie. The street is mostly empty. The bakery is dark. The green pharmacy cross across the street blinks like a heartbeat.

They walk two blocks, turn around, walk back. The rain beads on Mara's eyelashes. The cold makes her fingers stiff. She doesn't mind. The air is honest out here.

When they return, the generator is still humming. The lobby is still full. The air is still warm. The detector in the corner blinks its patient green. Mara feels her head throb at the base of her skull.

They go back upstairs because there is nowhere else to go.

In the room, the air is cooler because the window is open. The rain has soaked the curtain. The bed feels damp. The detector blinks. The hum is a low vibration through the wall.

Mara takes off her shoes and finds her socks are wet through, the rain having crept in when they walked the block. She peels them off and rubs her toes with the hem of her hoodie, the small ritual of warmth that feels like a child's trick. Her fingers are a little clumsy. The skin on her hands feels thick, as if she is wearing thin gloves she cannot see. She flexes them and pretends it is just cold.

She looks at the cheap detector and imagines the air around it as a set of numbers only a machine can read. She wishes she had that sense, that she could walk through a room and feel the parts where the air is thin. She thinks about her videos, about the way she can spot bad lighting in a room at a glance. She wonders why she never learned to spot bad air.

Mara lies down fully dressed. She tells herself she will not sleep while the generator runs. She tells herself she will get up every ten minutes and check. She tells herself that if the detector alarms she will wake Hannah and leave the building, no matter what.

Her eyes close anyway, because exhaustion is heavier than fear.

She wakes to Hannah shaking her shoulder. "Mara," she whispers. "Hey. Are you awake?"

Mara blinks. The room is dark. The hum is still there. The detector blinks green. Her mouth tastes like pennies and candle wax.

"What?" she croaks.

"You were talking," Hannah says. "You said the word hum. Like you were stuck on it." Her voice is low and worried.

Mara sits up. Her head swims. She presses her fingers to her temples. "I'm fine," she says, because it's the only word she has left.

The detector chirps once. A small, sharp sound. It doesn't alarm. The green light keeps blinking.

Mara stares at it and waits for the next sound. It doesn't come.

The hum continues. The rain keeps falling. The air in the room feels warm at her throat and cold at her cheeks. She thinks about the word exposure on her blood test, about the generator in the patio, about the message on her phone that told her not to sleep.

She doesn't know if the warning is for her or for the building. She doesn't know if the hum is just a machine or a mouth.

She lies back down and listens to the generator eat the night.
