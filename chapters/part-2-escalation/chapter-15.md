# Chapter 15: The Heat That Follows

The heater in the hallway coughs itself awake before dawn, and Mara wakes with the taste of pennies in her mouth.

For a second she can't tell which room she's in. The ceiling fan is different, the walls are a cleaner white, the faint lemon smell is more chemical than homey. The green dot on the little detector on her nightstand blinks, calm and stupidly cheerful. She watches it blink, waiting for it to do something dramatic. It doesn't. The heater exhales another hot breath under the door, and the taste stays.

She sits up. The room is cold around the edges and warm at the throat, like someone poured tea on a blanket. She presses her palm to the wall. It is warm. The air feels dry, and the dryness makes the metallic taste sharper, like it's scraping her tongue.

She tells herself it's the soup from last night, the garlic turning into ghosts. She tells herself it's the altitude. She tells herself she is not the kind of person who wakes up in a safe room and decides it isn't safe. That is a bad habit, a paranoid habit, a bad vibe. She has made a career out of not being that person. The girl in her videos is always calm, even when she is warning people about bedbugs.

The heater coughs again. The detector blinks green.

Hannah murmurs on the other bed, still asleep, her hair spilling like dark paint. Mara slips out of bed and pads to the door. When she cracks it open, the warm air rolls in like a visitor. The hallway smells faintly of dust and something sweet. Not the bakery sweet, the burnt-sugar sweet from the old room. Her stomach tightens.

She pulls the door closed and leans her forehead against it, breathing through her nose, checking herself for drama. It's probably just the heater dust burning off. It's probably just memory. The old hostel has been living in her mouth for days now. It has learned to pay rent.

The detector chirps once, a quick, high squeak, like a small animal. Mara looks at it. The green light blinks. She presses the test button, and it beeps in a rapid pattern that makes her heart jerk. She lets go. The beeps stop. The green light keeps blinking.

Cheap, she thinks. Cheap and cheerful. She bought the cheapest one because she wanted it right away, because the pharmacy shelf was a wall of plastic boxes and she took the one her hand found first. It could have a weak battery. It could be sensitive. It could be telling her something and she doesn't want to learn its language.

She opens her phone and types "carbon monoxide detector chirp once" into the search bar. The first result says low battery. The second says fault. The third says, in all caps, GET OUT.

She closes the tab.

Hannah wakes as Mara is putting on her hoodie. "What time is it?"

"Too early," Mara says. She tries to make it light. "The heater's on." She says it like a joke and watches Hannah's face for alarm.

Hannah frowns. "It's cold. It's fine." She pulls the duvet over her head. "If we're leaving today, I want more sleep."

If we're leaving today. Mara wants that sentence to be a fact. It has become a weather forecast instead.

She goes downstairs for coffee because movement feels safer than stillness. The lobby is dim and quiet, the night desk clerk asleep with his chin on his chest. The green detector in the corner blinks. The coffee machine gurgles. The bakery next door is already awake, and the smell of warm dough comes in with the draft like a small kindness.

On the lobby television, the morning news is on with the sound low. A banner scrolls across the bottom in Spanish: CIERRE TEMPORAL DE HOSTAL POR FUGA DE GAS. Temporary closure of hostel due to gas leak. They show a shot of a taped door that Mara recognizes in her bones. Her face is not on the screen. The building is.

She stirs her coffee until it goes cool.

The receptionist from last night appears, yawning, his hair flattened on one side. He sees her and gives a small nod that says, yes, you're still here. It is not a question.

"Buses?" Mara asks. She is trying to sound casual, the way you ask about the weather in a place you don't belong.

He shrugs. "Maybe this afternoon. Protest still. Police maybe move." He gestures at the television with his chin. "City is..." He spins his hand in a circle, the universal sign for chaos.

Mara nods. She knows this circle. She has ridden it in enough cities to recognize the shape.

She returns to the room with two coffees and a plastic croissant. Hannah sits up, hair in a messy top knot, eyes puffy. Mara hands her the cup like a peace offering.

"We might not leave today," Mara says.

Hannah sighs. "We can try again. We'll go to the station. If it works, it works. If not, we come back. It's not the end of the world." She smiles, and the smile is tired. "It's just a bus."

It is never just a bus when you're trying to outrun a story.

They pack anyway because hope is a muscle you can fake. Mara stuffs her clothes into her bag without folding. She keeps the cheap detector out, slides it into her hoodie pocket, and then thinks better and puts it back on the nightstand. She has a superstition now: if it is in the room, it will do its job. If it is in her bag, it will be an unused warning on a bus that never comes.

On the way out, she opens the window a crack. The air is cold and wet. It smells like rain and bread, and for a second the metal taste fades. She closes the window when Hannah tells her to hurry.

They take a taxi to the bus station again. The driver turns up the heat because Mara looks pale, and the warm air in the car is thick and stifling. She rolls down the window an inch. The driver glances at her in the mirror and frowns. She shrugs, as if she is just a tourist with a cold, not a person who is afraid of air.

At the station, the line at their bus company's window is longer than yesterday. People hold tickets like prayers. A man in a baseball cap argues into his phone. A toddler sleeps on a suitcase. The air smells of diesel and fried meat, a combination that feels like a dare.

The woman behind the window shakes her head before Mara can finish her sentence. "No buses today," she says. "Protest. Maybe tomorrow."

Hannah and Mara exchange a glance that feels like déjà vu and punishment. Hannah asks about another company. The woman shrugs. Another company is also not running. Another company is also stuck.

Mara wants to laugh. She wants to scream. She does neither. She takes the ticket, folds it back into her wallet, and returns to the taxi stand with her shoulders stiff, as if holding herself too straight will keep her from crumpling.

On the drive back, she sees a line of police vans and a group of people standing at an intersection with signs. The signs are too far away to read. She can hear shouting through the taxi glass. The driver mutters something about politics and taxes and tourists. Mara sinks lower in the seat and feels, for a moment, like she is being held hostage by a city that isn't even looking at her.

Back at the hostel, the lobby is busier. A group of German backpackers are clustered around a map, laughing with the big, easy laughs of people who haven't been to the hospital. The receptionist is explaining something about tours, drawing circles on a brochure. The green detector in the corner still blinks. The bakery smell is stronger, bread and sugar and something burnt.

Mara's head hurts in a slow, pulsing way. She rubs her forehead and tries to ignore it. She is tired of her body feeling like a rumor. She is tired of being the person who checks the air and counts her breaths.

"Maybe we should do something," Hannah says as they sit on the couch. "If we're stuck, we might as well walk around."

Mara thinks about the news, about the taped door, about the way the old hostel looks on television. She thinks about making a video, a calm, helpful video, a sequence of tips and a soft warning. She thinks about the comments it would get: This happened to me. Thanks for sharing. You're so brave. She feels the old itch of content, of making the scary thing useful.

"We can go to the market," she says. "Just to get outside." She doesn't say, just to breathe air that isn't recirculated by a heater.

Outside, the city is gray and damp. The street smells like wet stone and gasoline. Vendors shout under plastic tarps. The rain is a fine mist that makes everything look soft at the edges. Mara pulls her beanie down and walks fast, because walking fast makes her feel like she is going somewhere instead of lingering.

At the market, she buys fruit and spices and a small bag of coffee beans because she wants to bring something home someday, to prove that there was a home. She watches a woman flip tortillas on a hot plate, the steam rising in a white cloud. She lifts her phone and shoots a quick clip, the way she always does, her hands steady even when her stomach isn't.

"You okay?" Hannah asks when Mara lingers too long by a stall with little wooden masks.

"Yeah," Mara says. She isn't sure why she is standing there. The masks are painted in bright colors, their mouths frozen in smiles or open in silent screams. She stares at one with a thin, red mouth and thinks about oxygen masks. She buys a small one because it costs two dollars and because she wants to, for once, choose the symbol instead of being chased by it.

Her phone buzzes. A new message from a blank account.

Stay warm.

Mara's skin prickles. She looks around the market as if the sender might be waving at her from behind a pile of mangoes. She closes the message and drops the phone into her pocket. It could be anyone. It could be a bot. It could be the same bored person who keeps typing into her inbox. She tells herself it's nothing. She tells herself to stop looking for patterns in noise.

She buys a hot chocolate from a vendor and takes a sip. The sweetness coats her tongue, and for a moment the pennies fade. The hot chocolate tastes like childhood and cinnamon. It tastes like a trick.

They walk past a pharmacy on the way back, and Mara slows without thinking. The front window is a wall of pills and sunscreen and cheap plastic travel kits. A stack of detectors sits on a shelf by the door, the same blue box she bought yesterday. She stands there, staring at them as if they might have answers printed on their faces.

"Do you want another one?" Hannah asks. "For the room?"

Mara shakes her head. "No. It's fine." She hears how thin the word sounds and hates it. She goes inside anyway, because being in a pharmacy feels like being in a place where problems can be fixed by selecting something off a shelf.

The pharmacist is a woman with gray hair tied back in a neat knot. She rings up a man with a cough and then looks at Mara. "Oxygen can?" she asks in English, tapping the shelf behind her.

Mara nods. "And batteries," she says. She doesn't need to explain what for. In this city, everyone seems to know the word monóxido now.

The pharmacist rummages under the counter and shakes her head. "No AA. Delivery late." She points toward a cardboard box of candles. "Power is not good."

Candles feel like a warning. Mara imagines a room with a candle burning while someone sleeps, the flame nibbling at the air. She backs away from the box and buys the oxygen can anyway, because it's what she came for. The can is cold in her hand, a small metal reassurance.

As she pays, she notices a handwritten sign taped to the counter. PRECAUCIÓN CON GENERADORES. Be careful with generators. There is a little drawing of a house with waves rising from a pipe. She asks the pharmacist about it.

"Some hostels use generator when power off," the woman says. Her English is careful. "They put it inside, in patio. Bad." She gives Mara a look that is both warning and exhaustion. "Open window. Do not sleep if headache."

Mara nods, her stomach tight. She thinks about the hum in the hallway last night, about the portable heater in the lobby, about the sealed windows against the rain. She says, "Okay," because that is her only word.

Outside, the rain has picked up. They pass a narrow alley where a small generator is running under a tarp, its exhaust curling in a thin gray stream. Two men stand nearby, smoking. The generator's hum is lower than the sound in her room, but it makes the same throat-tightening vibration in her chest. She holds her breath and keeps walking, her steps a little faster.

At a corner, she sees the guy with the man bun from the clinic. He is leaning against a lamppost with a coffee, his eyes hooded. He looks up and recognizes her. They share the quick, uncomfortable nod of people who have breathed the same bad air.

"You okay?" he asks. His voice is hoarse.

"Yeah," Mara says. She pauses, then adds, "You?"

He shrugs. "They said I'm fine. I don't feel fine." He rubs his temple and gives a small humorless laugh. "Apparently the numbers are good."

Mara thinks about the clip on her finger, about ninety-nine. "Numbers lie," she says. It's more honest than she intended.

He looks at her for a second like he might say more, then his phone buzzes and he glances away. "Take care," he says. He walks in the opposite direction, shoulders hunched against the rain.

Mara watches him go and feels a sudden, ugly surge of envy. He is walking away. He is moving. He is not trapped in a loop of canceled buses and blinking green lights. She tells herself that tomorrow she will be him, walking away with a coffee and a shrug. She tells herself it like a prayer.

By the time they get back to the hostel, the sky has darkened to an early evening gray. The air feels colder. The lobby lights are on, and there is a portable heater near the couch that wasn't there this morning. It is taller than the wall heater in her old room, a metal cylinder with a glowing orange grid. Someone has put it beside a rack of brochures like it is a decorative plant.

The receptionist shrugs when Mara points at it. "Cold today," he says. "We use heater for common room."

Mara looks up. The green detector in the corner blinks. She thinks about the heater in her old room, about the tape over the vents, about the little box on the wall with the red light dead. She remembers the warning in her phone translation: DO NOT COVER VENTS. She looks at the lobby windows. They are closed. The rain taps against the glass like fingernails.

"Is it gas?" she asks.

He shakes his head. "Electric."

Mara is not sure she believes him. She has learned that hostels say things like it's okay and it's fine and we have it handled, and those words are not guarantees. But she doesn't argue. She is tired of being the person who asks. She is tired of looking crazy.

Upstairs, the hallway is warm again. The heater under the window is on, the metal casing pinging as it warms. Hannah drops her bag and kicks off her shoes. "I'm going to shower," she says. "Then we can see if the kitchen has dinner."

"Okay," Mara says. The word comes out flat. She sits on the bed and stares at the detector on her nightstand. The green light blinks. She watches it for a full minute, and it doesn't flicker.

She thinks about the blood test paper in her bag, the word exposure printed there like a stamp. She thinks about the oxygen hiss in the clinic, the way the relief felt like cheating. She thinks about her followers, about the way she has to be calm and useful, the way she can't be a person who is frightened of air.

She opens her notes app and types a list: SAFETY VIDEO. Tips: check detectors, open windows, don't sleep with heater on, trust your symptoms. She stares at the last line and deletes it.

The shower starts in the bathroom, a rush of water through pipes. The sound is comforting and also makes her think about the old hostel, the water outage, the sign. She gets up and opens the window a few inches, despite the cold. The air drifts in, damp and sharp. The heater hums. The corridor smells faintly of the sweet burn again. The taste of pennies returns as if someone flipped a switch.

Her phone buzzes. A message from her mother: "Any update?"

Mara types: "Buses delayed. Still here. Feeling better."

She adds a smiley face and feels like a liar.

She closes the window because the rain is coming in now, a cold mist that makes her blankets feel clammy. The room warms quickly. The heater under the window clicks. She sits on the bed and presses the test button on the detector again. It beeps. It does not alarm. The green light blinks, steady, stupid, reassuring.

Hannah comes back from the shower wrapped in a towel, cheeks pink from steam. "We should eat," she says. "If the kitchen's open."

Mara stands, a little slower than she wants, and follows.

The kitchen is crowded. A group of Australians are making pasta. A man with a man bun is flipping eggs. The windows are fogged from steam. The air smells of garlic and wet towels. There is a small sign on the wall, new, printed and taped: PLEASE DO NOT USE GAS STOVE DURING POWER OUTAGES. USE MICROWAVE ONLY. There is a smiley face at the bottom, the same font as the water outage sign at the old hostel.

Mara reads it twice. "Power outage?" she asks a woman chopping onions.

"They said it's likely tonight," the woman says, shrugging. "City's being weird."

Mara nods as if she understands what that means. She looks at the stove. It is off. The burners are dark. She looks at the microwave, its green clock blinking in a different rhythm than the detector's. She feels suddenly exhausted.

They eat pasta because it's the easiest thing, and because Hannah cooked it and that means Mara doesn't have to decide. The pasta is bland. The garlic helps. The air is hot and damp. Mara drinks water and tries not to think about lungs.

Someone in the corner is complaining about the Wi-Fi. Someone else is laughing too loudly at a joke. The kitchen is a small, loud planet. It feels safe in the way crowds feel safe, as if being around other people's breathing will dilute whatever is wrong with her own.

When they return to the room, the power is out.

The lights in the hallway are off, and the corridor glows with a few emergency bulbs, dim and yellow. Someone down the hall curses. A door opens and closes. The heater under the window goes silent. The fan in their room clicks off, leaving a thick quiet that makes the air feel heavier.

"Great," Hannah says. She holds her phone up, flashlight on, a small cone of light bouncing on the wall. "At least it's not water."

Mara laughs because it's a joke. It is also not funny.

She sets her bag down and sits on the bed. The room is colder without the heater. The window is closed because the rain has turned into a steady sheet. The air is still. The detector's green light blinks, a tiny lighthouse in the darkness.

The hallway smells different. She can't place it at first. It is not bread. It is not soap. It is faintly sweet and faintly oily, like a candle that has been left too long. She tells herself it's just the heater cooling down, dust burning off. She tells herself the bakery is running late. She tells herself she is too sensitive.

Hannah sits on her bed and scrolls through her phone. "We should sleep," she says. "We're leaving tomorrow no matter what."

Mara wants to agree. She wants to believe that. She also wants to get up and open the window again. She wants to take the detector and hold it to the hallway, to the air itself, as if it could prove a point.

Instead, she says, "Yeah." She lies back, pulls the blanket up to her chin, and listens to the rain.

Somewhere downstairs, the lobby heater clicks on, or maybe it is a generator. A low hum starts up, a sound like a refrigerator struggling. The green dot keeps blinking. It does not change. The cheap plastic does not know or does not care about the new sound in the building.

She remembers the warning sign in the kitchen: no gas stove during power outages. She remembers the portable heater by the couch. She imagines it plugged into a generator, pulling air from a sealed lobby, warming a crowd of tourists while the windows stay shut against the rain. She imagines the receptionist saying it's electric, shrugging with the shrug of someone who never thinks about invisible gases. She imagines the air in the lobby getting slowly richer, thicker, warmer, as if the building itself is exhaling.

She turns on her side. Her head feels heavy. The pennies taste stronger. She tells herself it's because she didn't brush her teeth. She tells herself she will do it in the morning. She tells herself she is safe in a new hostel with a green blinking light that she bought herself.

Her phone buzzes again. She doesn't want to look. She looks anyway.

You carry it.

The same message, the same two words. She flips the phone face down, as if that can hide the words. Her heart beats a little faster, a small staccato against her ribs. She thinks about carbon monoxide in her blood, about the blood test paper, about the word exposure printed in black.

Her detector chirps once, the small animal sound again. She sits up, waiting for the alarm. It doesn't come. The green light keeps blinking, patient and steady. She presses the test button. It beeps in the dark. Hannah groans and turns over.

"Sorry," Mara whispers.

She stares at the ceiling and waits for the sound of the generator to stop. It doesn't. The rain keeps tapping. The smell in the hallway gets a little sweeter, or maybe her brain is primed to smell it. She thinks about leaving the window open, but it is cold, and her headache is back, and she is exhausted in a way that feels like gravity.

She pulls the blanket tighter, like a kid hiding from a monster under the bed. The green light blinks. One. Two. Three. The rhythm is a metronome for her breathing. She counts her breaths to match it. One. Two. Three. The numbers are a spell and a trap.

In the dark, she tells herself that tomorrow she will leave no matter what. In the dark, she tells herself that if the detector doesn't scream, she doesn't have to.

The heater down the hall hums. The rain thickens. The taste of pennies sits on her tongue like a coin she cannot spit out.
