# Chapter 12: The Taste That Stays

The air in the new hostel tastes like soap and bread and that doesn't stop Mara from tasting the old hostel anyway.

She can rinse her mouth and scrub her hair and peel off her wet socks, but the metallic sweetness still sits on the back of her tongue, a stubborn penny that refuses to dissolve. It is stubborn in the way of a bad memory. It makes her teeth feel like they've been licked by a battery. She swallows and it stays.

"It's the rain," she tells Hannah on the couch, the words a thin ribbon she ties around her own neck so she can pretend she has control. "Just cold." She says it again, like repetition will make it true. Hannah looks at her like she doesn't believe it but doesn't want to argue.

The lobby is quiet at night, a soft white rectangle that feels sterile and kind. A stack of clean towels is folded on the counter. The coffee machine hums to itself. The detector in the corner blinks green, patient and steady, its small eye watching like it knows what it means to keep breathing.

Mara watches it, then looks away before Hannah notices.

"You want tea?" Hannah asks. She says it in the same tone she would use to offer someone a blanket at a funeral. Comfort as habit.

"No," Mara says. "Water." She holds up the bottle like a prop in a scene. The water is room temperature and tastes like plastic. She drinks anyway. The swallow does nothing to quiet the taste of the old hostel, the aftertaste of a room with too much heat and not enough air.

She should feel grateful. She should feel safe. Her passport is back in her jacket pocket, the corners bent but the name intact. The new hostel has windows and light and a receptionist who cares enough to blink. Hannah is here. There is no gas heater on the wall. There is no reason to feel dread.

But dread is not reasonable. Dread is just a smell you can't scrub out.

She feels the headache grow behind her eyes, a pressure that settles in like a tenant who paid a deposit. She takes the oxygen can from her jacket pocket and turns it over in her hands. The little plastic nozzle is still pressed from her mouth earlier. She gives herself a short hiss, a comic wheeze of canned air and placebo, a ritual she pretends is a joke.

"You're really into the oxygen thing," Hannah says, eyebrow raised.

"Altitude," Mara says. "Budget lung care." She forces a smile. It lands crooked.

Hannah shakes her head. "If it makes you feel better." She doesn't say the other part, the part where she doesn't want Mara to pass out alone.

They sit for a while, listening to the quiet hum of the lobby. A couple comes in from the rain, dripping on the tile. A staff member wipes the floor with slow, resigned strokes. The air smells like lemon cleaner and fresh bread from the closed bakery next door, a good smell that should be enough to drown out anything else. Mara breathes it in and still tastes metal.

She tells herself to sleep. Sleep will fix it. Sleep fixes everything that isn't real. She tells herself that exposure is over. She is out. The room with the heater is behind her. The passport is in her pocket. The story is done.

When she stands, her legs feel slightly too far away. The couch springs sigh under her. She blinks until the room stops tilting. It does, eventually. It always does. She has gotten good at waiting for her body to be herself again.

"I'm going up," she says.

"I'll text you in the morning," Hannah says.

"I'll answer," Mara says. She is not sure she means it.

In her room, the air is clean and cool. The ceiling fan turns in slow, steady circles, a hypnotist in an old movie. The window is cracked. She can hear the street, the far cough of a bus, the bark of a dog. It is a normal soundscape. She should sleep.

She takes a shower anyway, because showers are a way of pressing reset. The water is hot and honest. She scrubs her hair twice, as if the shampoo can wash away the sweet smell in her memory. She lets the steam open her sinuses and hopes it blows the old hostel out like smoke. When she steps out and wraps herself in a towel, her lips are still too pink, her eyes still a little too glossy.

She sees herself in the mirror and frowns. The person looking back is the kind of girl who posts sunrise pictures and writes captions about gratitude. The person looking back also looks hungover, and Mara hasn't even had a drink. She taps her lips, waiting for the color to fade. It doesn't.

She sits on the bed and checks her phone. There are a handful of notifications, mostly comments on her market video and a message from her mother asking if she got her passport back. Mara types, Got it, all good. She adds a heart and hopes it counts as kindness.

Another message sits below it, a private request from an account with a blank profile and a string of numbers. The preview reads: You went back.

Her stomach flips. She doesn't open it. She blocks the account on instinct, a small act of control that leaves her hands slightly shaking. She tells herself it's a troll, a bored person scrolling through Quito tags and making a game of strangers. She tells herself it can't know anything. She tells herself her life is not a ghost story.

She slips the phone face down and lies back. The fan turns. The air moves. She should sleep.

Sleep comes in thin sheets. She drifts, she wakes. The dream is the same water as before, but this time the water tastes like pennies and burnt sugar, and the light above her is a small blinking green dot. The dot turns red and then it is taped over, and the tape is silver and smooth and presses against her skin like a mouth.

She wakes with a start, the sheet twisted around her legs. Her heart is racing. The room is dark. The fan hums. The green dot on the detector in the hallway leaks a thin light under her door. She holds her breath and listens to it. It doesn't beep. It doesn't do anything. It just watches.

She rolls onto her side. The taste is still there. The old hostel has found a way to follow her into a room without a heater. She swallows and tries not to gag. Her fingers feel a little numb. She flexes them. They answer sluggishly, like she's asking them through a wall.

"Stop," she whispers to herself. "You're fine." The words sound like they are for someone else.

She sleeps again, finally, and in the morning the headache is a dull drumbeat that refuses to leave.

---

The pharmacy across the street smells like menthol and antiseptic, a smell that feels like a clean slap. The green cross sign blinks in the damp daylight. Inside, there are shelves of vitamins and cough drops and boxes with pictures of lungs that look too healthy to be real.

Hannah stands by the door with her wet hair tucked under a hood, scrolling through her phone. Mara sits on a plastic chair that squeaks under her weight. The pharmacist is a woman with tidy braids and the kind of calm that comes from seeing the same problems all day. She has already asked Mara if she is pregnant, if she has a fever, if she has diarrhea. Mara has said no to all of it and yes to the headache.

"Altitude," the pharmacist says. She says it like a diagnosis and a dismissal. "Quito does this. Water, rest." She holds up a small plastic clip. "We check your oxygen?"

Mara nods. The clip goes on her finger. It squeezes, a tiny clamp of concern. The screen beeps and shows numbers. Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine. The pharmacist nods, satisfied. "Very good," she says. "You are fine. Maybe caffeine. Maybe no alcohol." She pushes a box of acetazolamide across the counter and a packet of coca tea. "And for headache." She taps a blister pack of painkillers.

Mara stares at the numbers as if they are a magic trick. She feels anything but fine. The room feels too bright. The air smells sharp. The numbers keep blinking, indifferent. She knows, dimly, that the little clip can't tell her everything. She doesn't know what, exactly, but she knows the way a good lie looks. It looks like a number that reassures the person holding it.

She pays for the pills and the tea. Her card works. Her passport is in her pocket. The world is in order, which is its own kind of cruelty.

On the wall behind the pharmacist, a display of detectors hangs in neat rows. The boxes are white with pictures of smiling houses and tidy families. Carbon Monoxide Detector, the English reads, and below it a Spanish warning about silent killers. The boxes are cheap, plastic, banal. Mara stares a moment too long.

"You need one?" the pharmacist asks, following her gaze.

"No," Mara says too quickly. She adds, "Just curious." She makes a small laugh and the pharmacist smiles politely, the way you do when you don't want a stranger to confess.

They step back onto the street with a small pharmacy bag swinging between Mara's fingers. The air outside is wet, the kind that clings to skin. Her head still feels full of fog. Hannah squeezes her shoulder.

"You feel better?" she asks.

"The finger thing says I'm excellent," Mara says. She tries to make it a joke. It lands like a pebble.

Hannah gives her a look. "We can take it easy today. Do laundry, stay in, whatever." Her voice is gentle, but the edge of concern is still there, a sharp line under the softness.

Mara wants to agree. She wants to crawl under a blanket and let her body reset. She also wants to prove she is not a fragile thing that can be ruined by air.

"Let's do laundry," she says. "Normal stuff." Normal is the word she keeps reaching for like a railing.

The laundromat is down the street, a bright room full of machines that spin and groan. The air inside is hot and damp and smells like soap. Mara feeds the machine with coins and watches her clothes tumble like a slow storm. The spin makes her dizzy. She focuses on her phone instead, scrolling through comments on her videos, giving out heart emojis like bandages.

One comment on her last post reads, "You okay? You look... off." Another says, "Quito is no joke, girl. The air is weird." She laughs without sound. Everyone thinks the air is weird; no one says the word for why.

Her phone buzzes with a news alert. It isn't from a news app, it's from the hostel's Wi-Fi portal, a local update that flashes across the screen as she tries to log in. The headline is in Spanish: INSPECCION DE CALEFACTORES EN HOSTALES DEL CENTRO. Heater inspections in central hostels. The text is small, the date is today. She taps it, but the Wi-Fi stalls and the page won't load. The headline is all she gets.

She shows it to Hannah. "Looks like they're doing inspections," she says, forcing a casual tone.

Hannah frowns. "After what?"

"Probably nothing," Mara says. She hears herself. She is already building the wall of rationalization. "Just routine. Weather and all. The city probably freaks out every rainy season." She is not sure if that's true. She says it anyway.

Hannah doesn't argue. She only says, "Maybe we should stay away from that place," and they both know which place she means.

They fold warm clothes and leave. The day stays gray. The air stays wet.

On the walk back, a man with a backpack stops them on the corner. He is pale and a little wild-eyed. He speaks in English with a German accent. "Hey," he says. "You stay at the old hostel? The one with the gas heaters?"

Mara's stomach tightens. "No," she says too fast. She corrects, "We did. We moved. Why?"

"My friend is there," he says. He pulls out his phone and shows a text, the letters tiny and blurred by rain. He says, "He doesn't answer. They say there was a leak last night. Police maybe. I don't know." He laughs once, a short, high sound. "Maybe it's just the rain.

Mara hears her own line thrown back at her. She wants to tell him that the rain doesn't make heaters leak. She wants to tell him that gas doesn't care about weather. She wants to tell him a hundred things. She doesn't.

"Try reception," Hannah says, steady and practical. "Sometimes the phones don't work with the storms. Or go there. Check." She pauses, her eyes flicking to Mara. "Maybe don't go alone." It is a gentle warning, as if the building might bite.

The man nods and runs off, his backpack bouncing. Mara watches him go, a small knot tightening in her chest. She does not want to go back. She does not want to know. She wants to stay in the safe rectangle of the new hostel and pretend the old one is a story she is done telling.

She takes the acetazolamide when they get back. It tastes like chalk and makes her fingers tingle. The tingling is supposed to be normal. She hates it anyway. She drinks the coca tea, which tastes like warm hay. She waits for the headache to ease.

It doesn't.

She tries to nap in her room, because naps are the closest thing to a reset she can afford. She lies down with the window cracked and the fan stirring the air in slow circles. Her body sinks into the mattress with a relief that feels too deep. Ten minutes later she is awake, not rested, just heavier. The headache has moved from her temples to the base of her skull, a low ache like someone is pressing a thumb there and not letting go.

She stares at the ceiling and decides to be productive instead. If she can work, she tells herself, she must be fine. She sets up her camera on the desk and props her phone against a stack of travel guides. She hits record. Her mouth finds the script out of habit: "Hey, friends, quick update from Quito—" The words sound wrong. Her voice is too flat, her eyes too bright. She watches herself on the screen and sees the sheen on her skin, the faint flush that makes her look like she's been running. She hasn't.

She tries again. "Altitude is no joke," she says, with a laugh that doesn't land. "Drink water, take it slow." It is a public service announcement and a lie. She stops the recording and deletes the clip. The delete button feels like a relief. She isn't ready to make a story out of this. She isn't ready to make it consumable.

Her phone buzzes with a comment on yesterday's post. "Stay safe. That hostel is haunted lol." Another says, "If you need oxygen in Quito maybe you should go home." The tone is playful, but it presses on something sore. She tosses the phone onto the bed. It bounces and lands face down like a person who doesn't want to hear.

She opens her jacket and checks her passport again, a nervous tic she hates. The cover is warm from her body. The gold letters are smudged. She flips it open, not to read it but to prove it exists. It is a small, absurd ritual. She laughs, a breathy sound. "I'm a mess," she tells herself. It is meant as a joke. It doesn't feel like one.

She goes back to the lobby, drawn by the sound of other people. The common room is filling up for the afternoon, travelers with damp hair and open laptops. She sits at the edge of the couch and watches the green dot on the detector in the corner. It blinks. It blinks. It blinks. The rhythm is a lullaby. She realizes she is timing her breaths to it and stops, annoyed with herself.

The receptionist with the nose ring walks by carrying a tray of clean mugs. "Everything okay?" she asks, because she is the kind of receptionist who asks.

"Yeah," Mara says. "Just altitude." She hates herself for how easily the lie comes. The receptionist nods. Everyone nods at altitude here. It is the city's catch-all excuse, the polite way to admit your body is not coping. It lets the city off the hook. It lets you off the hook too.

She wants to tell the receptionist about the inspection headline, about the man on the corner asking about a leak, about the word monóxido ringing in her ears. She doesn't. She doesn't want to be the person who brings bad air into a clean space. She doesn't want to make her fear someone else's problem.

By late afternoon, the lobby is full of damp jackets and quiet chatter. A salsa class starts in the common room. The instructor shouts "Uno, dos, tres" and the room fills with laughter. Mara watches from the edge, holding her tea like a shield. The music is loud and bright. It doesn't reach the fog in her head.

Hannah dances. She is good at it in the way some people are good at everything that involves their bodies. She smiles at Mara as she spins, hair flicking, and Mara tries to smile back. She feels like she is watching through glass.

Her phone buzzes again. A message from her mother: Please tell me you went to a doctor. Mara types, Just a pharmacy. They said I'm fine. She does not add the part where the number on the clip doesn't mean what she wants it to mean. She does not add the part where the taste still clings to her tongue like guilt.

She stands and goes outside for air. The courtyard smells of wet soil and basil. A cat sits on the wall, fat and indifferent. The rain is lighter now, a mist. She leans against the wall and breathes. The air is cool and damp and real. It helps for a moment.

Then the nausea hits, a slow wave. She swallows it down. She is learning the art of swallowing. She has swallowed embarrassment, fear, a dozen small insults in her career. She can swallow a little nausea.

She wants to be brave, so she decides they should pick up groceries for dinner. The market is still open. The walk will clear her head. She tells Hannah that. Hannah raises an eyebrow but agrees. They grab umbrellas and step back into the wet city.

The street smells of frying oil and rain. It is a normal smell, a good smell. At the corner, the pharmacy's green cross pulses. Across the street, a man sells skewers of meat under a blue tarp. The smoke from his grill curls up in the rain, a gray ribbon. Mara flinches at the smell, then scolds herself for it. Not everything that smells like burning is a threat. Not everything is about her.

They walk toward the market, passing the old hostel two blocks away on a narrow street. Mara slows without meaning to. The building is the same dull shape, the same old door. The street in front is crowded now, more than it should be. There is a small group of people with umbrellas huddled near the entrance. A police car idles at the curb, its lights off but its presence loud. A maintenance van is parked crookedly, back doors open.

"Let's keep going," Hannah says, reading her. Mara's feet don't.

The door to the hostel opens. Two men in gray uniforms carry a stretcher out between them, moving fast but careful. The body on the stretcher is covered by a blanket. The blanket is the dull blue of hostel laundry. A foot peeks out, bare and pink, toes lax. The sight is so ordinary and so wrong that Mara can't process it. It looks like someone napping in a bed they brought outside.

She feels the taste in her mouth sharpen, a jolt of pennies and burnt sugar. Her hands go cold inside her pockets. She hears Hannah say her name, soft and urgent, but her attention is locked on the blanket and the bare foot and the way the men tilt the stretcher to avoid the puddle.

"They're probably just sick," she hears herself say, because she doesn't know what else to do with the fear. The words are thin. They float away.

A woman in a neon vest steps out behind them, talking into a phone. "Sí, una ambulancia," she says. "Intoxicación por monóxido." Carbon monoxide. The word cuts through the rain and lands in Mara's chest like a stone.

She shouldn't understand it. She does.

Hannah pulls her gently by the sleeve. "Come on," she says. "We don't need to watch." Her voice is firm and kind.

Mara lets herself be pulled. She looks away, but the image sticks: the pink toes, the blanket, the slow hurry. She walks with her head down and the taste of metal thick on her tongue. She wants to run. Her legs are heavy.

At the market, the lights are too bright. The smell of fish hits her and she almost gags. She focuses on the list, the normal things: bread, eggs, coffee, tomatoes. She is good at lists. Lists make a world feel manageable.

Hannah buys a bag of oranges. The vendor presses one into Mara's hand and smiles. It is cold and dimpled. Mara smells it, sharp and alive. For a second, the metallic taste fades under the citrus. She closes her eyes and breathes it in. She opens them to Hannah's concerned face.

"You okay?" Hannah asks.

"Just tired," Mara says. The words are automatic now. They are the script she uses to keep other people from having to hold her fear. She doesn't want to be a burden. She also doesn't want to admit, out loud, that she heard the word monóxido and her body still tastes like a room that should have killed her.

On the way back, the stretcher is gone. The police car is still there. The hostel door is closed, its old paint dark with rain. The street is quiet now, the crowd dispersed. The old building looks smaller in the gray light, more tired, like it is exhausted from the effort of being dangerous.

"Maybe we should report what we saw," Hannah says.

"To who?" Mara asks. It comes out sharper than she intends. She rubs her forehead. The headache pulses behind her eyes. "I don't even know what we saw. A person. A blanket. A word." She shakes her head. "And I already got out." The words taste bitter.

Hannah doesn't argue. She only squeezes Mara's shoulder. The gesture is a quiet reminder that getting out doesn't mean you're done.

In the new hostel kitchen, they cook pasta and eat at the little table by the window. The window is open and the air moves. It is enough to make the steam from the pot drift toward the vent, a slow little dance. Mara watches it, mesmerized by the way air should behave. She eats without tasting. She hears the salsa music through the wall, a dull thump. She hears laughter. The world keeps going.

That night, she cannot sleep. She lies on her back and listens to the fan. The air is cool and clean, but her body feels heavy, like gravity has been turned up. She checks her phone and reads the news headline again, the one about inspections. She tries to load the article and the Wi-Fi spins. She gives up.

She opens her messages and there is a new one from an unknown account. The profile is blank. The message is only three words: You heard it.

Her throat goes dry. She throws the phone to the other end of the bed as if it is hot. She wants to laugh, to pretend it's a prank, but the word monóxido is still in her ears and the taste of pennies is still on her tongue. She turns the phone over with a pillow so she doesn't have to look at it, as if hiding it will stop it from being true.

She closes her eyes. The room is quiet. The fan hums. The detector's green dot blinks in the hallway. The air moves. She should be safe.

She is not sure she is, and that is the worst part.

In the dark, she feels her heart beat once, twice, then skip, a small hitch that makes her lungs stutter. She sits up, hand to her chest, and breathes through it. The oxygen can is on her nightstand. She reaches for it and gives herself a quick hiss. It tastes like plastic and hope.

She thinks of the person on the stretcher, of the bare foot and the blue blanket. She thinks of the tape over the detector and the sweet smell and the man sealing the vents with his thumb. She thinks of the receptionist taping over the chirping box like it was an annoyance. She thinks of the old door that remembered her hand.

She tells herself she will leave Quito early. She tells herself she will go somewhere with sea-level air and no gas heaters. She tells herself she will look up the word monóxido in English and not pretend she doesn't know what it means. She tells herself this as if telling it could make it true.

The room stays quiet. The taste stays.

She lies back down and watches the shadows move on the ceiling. In the hallway, someone laughs, then coughs, a deep, ugly sound that ends too quickly. Mara flinches. She counts her breaths until she drifts.

The last thing she thinks before sleep is that the air has learned her name.
