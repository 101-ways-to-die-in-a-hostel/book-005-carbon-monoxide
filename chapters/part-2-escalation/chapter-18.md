# Chapter 18: The Road That Refuses

The bus is supposed to leave at seven, and at seven the departures board politely tells her it will never happen.

Mara stands under a fluorescent strip that makes everyone look vaguely seasick. The terminal smells like diesel and instant coffee and the wet wool of a hundred jackets. The light is flat, the kind that makes shadows disappear. She misses shadows. Shadows at least prove there is depth to the world. Here, everything is a plane: the floor, the wall, the ceiling, the breath of all the people waiting.

A loudspeaker crackles, Spanish sliding over her head like rain. Hannah reads the board and swears under her breath. The words blink in a steady rhythm: CANCELADO. SUSPENDIDO. It feels like a glitch in a video game, like the level won't load and she's stuck at the menu screen.

She holds her phone up with the ticket confirmation open, the subject line still unbearably cheerful: Your Adventure Awaits. It has been her life for five years, a string of bold words and sponsor tags and photos that make anything look like a choice. The bus is a choice she already made. The bus doesn't agree.

A woman in a navy sweater sits on a plastic bench and says, loud enough for the line to hear, "No hay paso. Protesta en la carretera." No passage. A protest on the highway. People groan. A kid in a dinosaur hoodie cries. A man with a suitcase kicks a pillar. The bus station breathes in and out around them, a big concrete lung full of human steam.

Hannah squeezes Mara's elbow. "We can wait a bit," she says, as if time has been kind to them so far.

Mara nods, because waiting is what she has been doing since she landed in Quito. Waiting for her head to stop hurting, waiting for the air to feel normal, waiting for the world to stop telling her she is fine when she is not.

She sits on a bench and presses her palms to her knees. The bench is cold through her jeans. The air around her is warm, damp, and thick with engine breath. Buses idle in their bays with their mouths open, exhaust pipes burping into the low-ceilinged terminal. The smell is sweet and oily, the same note that keeps finding her like a bad perfume. She tells herself it is just diesel. She tells herself diesel and carbon monoxide are cousins, not twins.

Her cheap detector is in her hoodie pocket. She takes it out and sets it on the bench between them, its green light blinking like a tiny heartbeat. It looks ridiculous there, a plastic toy in a terminal full of engines. It blinks anyway. She presses the test button. It chirps once and goes back to blinking. The sound is swallowed by the terminal's roar.

A bus driver leans out of a window and spits onto the platform. "Tres horas," he says in Spanish. Three hours. A woman in a red scarf laughs like that is a punchline. A man in a suit shakes his head and walks out, phone pressed to his ear. The terminal shifts, a small human tide pulling toward exits and back again.

Mara feels a familiar pressure start at the base of her skull. It rises slowly, like water in a sink. She closes her eyes and breathes through her nose. The air smells like exhaust and sweat and the paper bag of empanadas someone is eating two benches away. She swallows and tastes metal. The pennies are back.

"We should go outside," she says.

"Outside is still the terminal," Hannah says, but she stands anyway. They walk toward the front doors and push through into the gray morning. The rain is a mist, soft and persistent. The air on the street is cooler, thinner, still laced with bus breath. It is not the clean relief she hoped for. It is something, at least, a change in texture.

A man in a cap is selling coffee from a cart. The steam curls into the damp air and disappears. Mara watches it as if it holds a secret. She buys a cup and warms her hands on it. The coffee tastes like burned sugar and keeps the nausea down for three minutes.

They stand under the awning and watch buses trickle in and out. The protest is a rumor now, a thing on everyone's lips and on no one's eyes. She checks her phone. The bus company's Twitter feed has a bland graphic about "temporary service interruptions." She scrolls through the replies: people yelling, people praying, people making jokes about walking to Baños. The joke isn't funny. The joke is air.

She feels her phone buzz and flinches. It is not a blank account, not yet. It is her mother, asking if the bus left. Mara types, "Delayed" and adds a little bus emoji like a lie that smiles.

Hannah goes to the bathroom and comes back five minutes later with a face that says she saw something. "There was a sticker in the stall," she says quietly. "Like a tag. @HostelReaper. Someone drew a little scythe. It's probably just some edgy travel blog, but..."

Mara's stomach dips. The name is so on-the-nose it feels fake, like a brand someone made for a Halloween bar crawl. She should laugh. She doesn't.

She thinks about the blank accounts that keep messaging her, about the photos of hallway doors and green blinking dots. She thinks about a person who would stick their handle in a bus station bathroom, like a calling card in a place where people come to leave.

"Did you take a picture?" she hears herself ask.

Hannah shakes her head. "Gross. Also no." She takes a sip of her coffee and watches Mara's face. "Hey. It's a sticker. People put their handles everywhere. It doesn't mean anything." She says it like an order.

Mara nods. She knows how to nod. She has nodded through flights and excuses and men's bad jokes and people calling her brave for being alone when it felt like being broke. She can nod through a sticker. It still sticks to the back of her mind.

A horn blares. A bus lurches forward, then stops. The driver gets out and lights a cigarette, because when you cannot move you might as well add smoke. Mara watches him exhale. The smoke is a ribbon she cannot help but follow.

She checks the board again. It hasn't changed. She decides that waiting here will only make her head worse. She decides they should go back and try again later, because that is what you do when a plan refuses you. You adjust. You loop.

"Let's go," she says to Hannah. It comes out like a command to herself. Hannah nods and doesn't argue.

They walk back through the terminal, past the benches and the bored ticket sellers and the line of people who look like they are made of patience and cold. Mara sees the sticker again on a pillar by the exit, black marker and a tiny scythe: @HostelReaper was here. She tells herself it is a teen with a Sharpie. She tells herself not to look back. She looks anyway.

Outside, the rain feels like a reset. It isn't. The air still tastes faintly sweet. She closes her mouth and breathes through her nose. The taste comes anyway. She thinks about how the body believes what it wants to believe. Her body has decided on a flavor.

They take a crowded bus back toward the hostel because taxis are scarce and ride apps show nothing but little cars with little slashes through them. The city slides past the fogged windows in gray smears: a mural, a dog, a bright sign for empanadas, a church dome. The bus is full of wet bodies and the breath of other people. Someone sneezes. Someone laughs. The air is dense, but at least it is moving, not trapped.

When they get off two blocks from the hostel, the rain has turned to a soft, cold drizzle. The bakery next door is open again, and the smell of bread hits her hard, sweet and warm. It is a smell that used to make her hungry. Now it makes her think of exhaust mixed with vanilla candles, of warm rooms with bad air. She hates that her brain has turned bread into a warning.

The hostel door opens with its familiar sticky resistance. Inside, the lobby is bright and warm. The portable heater glows orange like a small sun. The green smoke-only detector on the wall blinks its steady reassurance. People in damp jackets are sprawled across couches, arguing about whether the protest will end by lunchtime.

A hand-lettered sign hangs on the desk now: POWER OUTAGE POSSIBLE. GENERATOR IN USE. PLEASE KEEP BACK DOOR CLOSED. Another sign below it says, PLEASE KEEP WINDOWS CLOSED FOR SECURITY. The signs look like they were printed in a hurry, the paper curling at the corners as if trying to escape.

Mara stares at the windows sign. She thinks about the door she held open last night. She thinks about the cold air and the way it felt like a slap. She thinks about the staff member telling her rain is a reason. She thinks about security and oxygen and how the two are always positioned like enemies.

The receptionist glances up. He looks more tired than yesterday. His shirt is wrinkled. He smiles like he doesn't have energy for anything else. "Bus canceled?" he asks, as if it is small talk.

"Still," Hannah says.

He makes a sympathetic sound. "Maybe later," he says. "Protests. Not good." He taps the new sign with his pen. "We have generator again. For lights." He says lights like a gift.

Mara hears herself say, "Is it still under the canopy?" Her voice comes out too sharp. She tries again. "The generator. It's still in the courtyard?"

The receptionist blinks, then nods. "Rain," he says, as if it explains everything. "We put it under. It is outside. Is fine." He repeats the same spell.

She feels the urge to argue and the dread of being the person who argues. She has made a career out of making people like her. It is hard to break the habit when you need someone to care about your lungs.

She swallows. "Okay," she says, the word that lets her leave.

As they head up the stairs, she sees a key tag hanging behind the desk: ROOM 9. The number is written in black Sharpie. The key tag is empty, the ring bare. The room is available. The message from the blank account slips into her mind like a cold draft. Room nine is empty now.

She forces herself to look away.

---

In their room, she unzips her bag and pulls out the detector like it's a pet she has to check on. The green light blinks. She presses the test button. It chirps, obedient. Hannah watches her with the kind of patience that has a deadline.

"Maybe we should ask for a different room," Hannah says. "Higher up. Away from the courtyard." She says it carefully, as if she is offering the idea of switching seats on an airplane.

Mara imagines going back downstairs, asking for a move, being the problem guest. She imagines the receptionist's tired smile. She imagines the key tag for room nine. She imagines her phone buzzing with another blank message. She hates how small she feels in the face of that tiny loop of thoughts.

"It's fine," she says, because the word is a habit. "We'll leave tomorrow." She hears the promise and feels the weight of it. It is a promise she keeps making, a mantra that doesn't change the air.

They put wet clothes on hangers and crack the window despite the security sign. Rain beads on the sill. The air that comes in is cold and clean enough to hurt. Mara keeps it open anyway. She would rather be cold than sweet.

She sits on the bed and stares at her phone. The bus company has posted an update: SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. She reads it twice, because the words don't seem to belong to her day. She wants to screenshot it and post a story about how travel is full of surprises. She wants to be funny about it. The joke would be about embracing the chaos. The chaos would be in the room with her. She puts her phone down.

Hannah goes to find coffee. Mara stays behind. The room is quiet except for the rain tapping the window and the faint hum of something downstairs. She opens her laptop and looks up flights. The airport is hours away and the prices are not kind. She checks ride shares again. The screen fills with nothing.

She opens a travel forum and scrolls until she finds a thread: "Quito roadblocks - any way out?" The replies are a mix of desperation and luck. One person says they hitchhiked with a bread truck. Another says they slept in the terminal. A third says, "Stay where you are, the roads are not safe." The comment is liked twenty times. It reads like a warning from a stranger and a command from a parent.

She closes the laptop. The room is too small for the choices she has. She can hear people laughing in the hallway. The hostel is full of bodies and noise and light. It feels like a machine. She doesn't want to be in a machine right now.

She goes downstairs to the courtyard and pushes open the back door. The rain is steady, a curtain. The plastic canopy sags in the middle with a belly of water. The generator sits beneath it, black and wet, its casing trembling. The exhaust pipe has been extended with a length of metal duct now, a thin silver elbow that points toward the canopy wall. It looks like someone tried to fix a problem with a straw.

A staff member in a hoodie crouches near the generator, wiping water off the casing with a rag. He looks up at Mara, then back to the machine. He has the expression of someone who has already had this conversation too many times.

"You moved it," she says, trying to sound neutral.

"We put pipe," he says. "So smoke goes out." He gestures toward the wall of plastic. The exhaust curls upward and then rolls back down, trapped by the canopy like a ghost too tired to leave.

"It doesn't really go out," she says, and hears the edge in her voice. She feels it anyway. The air here is warm and faintly sweet. It clings to her jacket. The rain makes it worse, not better.

He shrugs. "It is outside." He points upward. The word outside hangs under the canopy like a lie.

Mara watches the exhaust curl. She imagines it sneaking through the back door into the hallway, into the stairs, into her room. She imagines it finding the corners where air settles and waits. She imagines it like a person with patience.

She backs away and closes the door, sealing the sweet air outside but letting it follow her anyway on her clothes.

In the lobby, a couple is arguing about the windows sign. One of them wants to open the front door for airflow. The receptionist says no. The couple says they'll be careful. The receptionist says security. The word is a lock.

Mara wants to tell them to open the door anyway. She wants to take the blame for the rain on the floor if it keeps the air moving. She doesn't. She steps past them and goes upstairs, her head already starting to throb again.

---

By late afternoon, the hostel smells like damp jackets and soup and a faint undertone of something sweeter. Mara can't tell if the sweetness is bread from the bakery or exhaust from the courtyard. The fact that she can't tell makes her angry. She sits on a couch in the common room with a book she isn't reading and watches the wall detector blink. It doesn't alarm. It doesn't do anything. It just blinks.

Her phone buzzes. It's a notification from a new follower on her travel account, an account named @HostelReaper. The profile picture is a black circle with a white scythe. The bio says, "Real reviews. Real deaths. No refunds." She stares at it. Her throat goes dry.

She taps the profile. There are only a few posts, all photos of hostel hallways and bathroom mirrors with scribbles in marker. One is a picture of a door in low light, a green dot glowing beneath it. The caption reads, "Doors keep people in, not air out." Another is a photo of a generator under a plastic canopy, the same shape as theirs, the same rain. The caption: "Outside doesn't count if it can't breathe." The posts are dated yesterday.

Her thumb hovers over the message button. She wants to scream at it, at whoever is behind it, at the fact that the name is now a thing. She wants to know if this is the same person who has been sending her messages, the same person who said don't sleep when the hum starts. She wants to ask why. She doesn't want to give it anything. She closes the app and locks the phone.

Hannah comes in with two coffees and sets one by her hand. "You look like you saw a ghost," she says.

"Just Instagram," Mara says, which is a joke and a truth.

"Do you want to get out of here for a bit?" Hannah asks. "We can walk. Or sit in the bakery. Or the church. Anywhere with fresh air." She says fresh air like it's a place you can order.

Mara wants to say yes. Her head is heavy. The air feels too warm in her throat. But the rain has gotten heavier. The streets are flooding. The idea of wading through it makes her feel exhausted in advance.

"Maybe later," she says.

They sit and drink their coffee in silence. The conversation around them is a steady wash: people talking about routes, about protests, about how their parents are worried. Someone laughs about how they're all going to be stuck here forever and then adds, "Kidding." Nobody laughs back. The joke lands like a damp towel.

The lights flicker once. The room pauses. Everyone looks up and then back down, as if the ceiling will make eye contact. The lights steady. A small, collective exhale happens that nobody acknowledges. Mara feels it in her chest, a soft release that doesn't last.

She checks her phone. A message from the bus company: SERVICE SUSPENDED. Another from her mother: "Are you safe?" She types, "Yes. Just delays." She sends it and immediately feels like she has lied to someone she loves.

She thinks about the @HostelReaper profile. She thinks about the posts, the captions that sound like the messages she got. She thinks about the way the account followed her instead of messaging, like a shift from whisper to announcement. She thinks about the tag in the bus station bathroom. She thinks about how someone has turned these warnings into branding. It feels like a joke the universe is playing, but the punchline is oxygen.

She goes upstairs to her room as the rain starts to hammer the windows. Hannah stays in the common room to talk to a couple about a shared taxi. Mara listens to the muffled voices through the door and feels a sudden, ridiculous loneliness. The hostel is full of people and she still feels alone.

In the room, she opens the window as far as it will go. The rain soaks the curtain. She doesn't care. The air is cold and damp and honest. The fan pushes it around, slow and steady. She sits on the bed and feels the headache pulse behind her eyes. She presses two fingers to her temple like she's trying to hold her skull together.

She takes the oxygen can from her bag and gives herself a quick hiss. The air is cold and thin and makes her cough. The can feels lighter now. She shakes it. It makes a small, empty rattle. She laughs once, a short bark that surprises her. It is not funny. It is absurd.

She hears the generator start before the lights go out. The hum rises through the wall, low and deep, like a throat clearing. The lights flicker once, twice, then die. The room drops into a darker shade of gray. The fan stops mid-rotation. The air stills.

She sits up, heart thudding. The detector on the nightstand blinks green. It does not alarm. The hum grows steadier. She can feel it in the bed frame.

She grabs her phone and opens the camera, not to film but to have light. In the small circle of brightness, she sees the moisture on the window, the damp curtain, the little green eye of the detector. She feels the sweet note in the air, faint but present, like a candle that burned too long. She swallows and tastes pennies.

Hannah knocks softly and comes in with her phone flashlight on. "Power's out," she says, as if there is any doubt. "They're running the generator again. Are you okay?"

Mara looks at her and nods too quickly. "Yeah. I'm fine." The words feel brittle. She doesn't want to be dramatic. She doesn't want to be the girl who can't handle a blackout in a city that has them all the time. She doesn't want to be the girl whose lungs are a problem people have to solve.

"We can go downstairs," Hannah says. "Or outside. The rain is awful, but..."

Mara looks at the window. The rain is a wall now. The street is a blur of silver. Going outside would mean getting drenched and cold and possibly mugged, if the security sign is to be believed. Staying inside means the hum and the sweet air and the green blinking light that doesn't know the difference.

"Let's wait a bit," she says. Her voice sounds like someone else. She hates that.

They sit on the bed in the dark and listen to the generator chew on the night. The hum is steady, patient. It feels like the building is purring. The rain drums the window. The air is warm at her throat, cold at her cheeks.

Her phone buzzes once, a small vibration in her hand. She looks. A message request from @HostelReaper.

She opens it before she can talk herself out of it. The message is a single line.

If the hum starts, don't trust the green light.

Her breath catches. She feels a cold prickling on her scalp. Hannah is watching her face, reading the light it gives off.

"What?" Hannah asks.

Mara turns the phone so she can read it. Hannah's face tightens. "Block it," she says, the same as before.

Mara doesn't. Not yet. The words sit on her screen, black letters on a bright background. She thinks about the detector blinking green. She thinks about how it has never not blinked. She thinks about the smoke-only sticker in the lobby. She thinks about how the green light is a promise it might not be able to keep.

She doesn't know what to do with the warning. She doesn't know if it is kind or cruel. She doesn't know if it is someone playing with her or someone trying to save her. She feels, for the first time, that the air itself is a person with a name.

She closes the message but doesn't block the account. She sets the phone face down and listens to the hum, to the rain, to Hannah's breathing. The detector blinks green. The hum continues.

She tells herself she will leave in the morning, that the roads will open, that the bus will come. She tells herself these things as if the road will listen. The road refuses.

The room grows warmer by degrees she can't measure. The green light blinks. The hum does not care.
