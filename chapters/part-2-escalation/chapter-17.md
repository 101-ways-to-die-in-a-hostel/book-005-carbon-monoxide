# Chapter 17: The Sleep That Betrays

She learns there are sounds you can sleep through and sounds you can't, and the hum is trying to become both.

It is in the walls now, a low, steady vibration that makes the mattress feel like a drumskin. Mara lies on her back, fully dressed, one hand on her chest like she's trying to keep her heart from wandering. The room is dark except for the tiny green dot on her cheap detector. It blinks once, twice, steady as a metronome. She tells herself she can stay awake as long as it stays green. She tells herself a lot of things when she's tired.

Hannah is already asleep, the soft rhythm of her breathing a counterpoint to the generator hum. Her sleep is a gift. It is also a kind of betrayal, because it proves that sleep can happen here, in this room, in this air. Mara keeps her eyes open until they blur. She counts the hums. She counts the blinks. She loses count and starts over.

The oxygen can sits on the nightstand like a cold soda. She taps it with her fingers, feeling the chill through the metal. A cheap miracle in a can. She wants to take a hit, just to see if the cool rush will chase away the metallic taste that has come back, thin but stubborn. She doesn't. She is rationing air now, which is its own joke. She can hear herself narrating it in her own voice, her on-camera voice: Travel tip! Don't ration oxygen in a room with a generator running downstairs.

She presses the test button on the detector. It beeps sharply in the dark. Hannah groans and turns, mumbling something that might be her name. The beep stops. The green light blinks. It is the only thing in the room that seems to know what it is doing.

The hum deepens for a moment, like the generator is swallowing. Mara feels it in her teeth. Her head throbs at the base of her skull, a dull hammer. She closes her eyes and sees the number ninety-nine in red and white. She sees the clinic ceiling fan wobbling. She sees the handwritten sign at the pharmacy: PRECAUCIÓN CON GENERADORES. The words are a loop now, like the hum.

She opens her eyes and sees the ceiling, a shadowed rectangle with the fan still as a dead spider. In the dark, the room is a box of air. It smells faintly of wet fabric and the vanilla candles from the lobby, and underneath it all, a sweet, oily note that could be exhaust or could be imagination. Her brain is too tired to decide which.

She rolls onto her side and looks at the window. It is cracked open, rain pushing in a cold edge that makes her nose burn. The curtain hangs damp and heavy. The cold air feels honest, but it doesn't reach the back of her throat where the taste of pennies lives. She is too aware of the geometry of air now. She can picture it: the cool line by the window, the warm pocket near the door, the soft eddy in the corner where the air doesn't move at all.

She tries to sleep sitting up, back against the headboard, knees drawn to her chest. She tries to sleep like she's on a plane, upright and braced. She lasts four minutes before her head tips forward and a dream starts.

In the dream, the green light is a heartbeat. It blinks, and each blink is a tiny door closing.

She jerks awake with her neck stiff and her mouth dry. The hum is still there, steady as a bad apology. She checks her phone. 2:11 a.m. The screen light makes her eyes ache. A new message notification sits at the top, a blank profile and a single line of text.

If you can read this, you're still awake.

She stares at the words. She thinks about the person who keeps sending these messages, about the blank accounts multiplying like mold. She thinks about the word still and how it could be a warning or a smug little joke. She thinks about replying, about typing Who are you? and watching the dots appear. She doesn't. She blocks the account. She sets the phone facedown like a curse.

Her head is thick and slow. She sits up, rubbing her temples. The room tilts a fraction and then steadies. She tells herself it's sleep and stress and the altitude and the pasta, the regular things that make people feel bad in a foreign city. She tells herself this because it is easier than accepting that the air might be betraying her again.

She swings her legs over the side of the bed. The floor is cool. The room is too warm for how dark it is, as if the heat is trapped. She remembers the note on the Wi-Fi portal: DO NOT USE HEATERS IN ROOMS. She looks at the wall heater, dark. She tells herself that means safety. It is a thought she wants to believe.

She pads to the door and opens it a crack. The hallway is lit by emergency bulbs that make everything yellow and sickly. The air is warmer out there. She can smell the exhaust more clearly, a thin sweet ribbon that makes her stomach clench. Someone laughs at the far end of the hall, a short bark that dies quickly.

She steps into the hallway and closes the door behind her quietly. She doesn't want to wake Hannah. She wants to be the one who can handle it. She doesn't even know what it is. She is still a person who wants to be capable.

The hum is louder here. It seems to come from below and behind the walls at the same time, as if the building itself is running on a motor. Mara walks toward the stairs. The carpet feels slightly damp under her bare feet, the kind of damp that means the rain has found a path.

At the landing, she pauses. The smell is stronger. It isn't overpowering. It is subtle and insidious, like perfume. It makes her think of the bakery next door and the way warm bread can mask the tang of something burnt. She wonders if anyone else smells it or if she is just sick now, if her nose has become a sensor nobody asked for.

She goes down the stairs to the lobby. The common room is lit by candles again, their flames tiny and steady. A group of guests sits around a low table playing cards. Someone has a guitar and is quietly strumming. Someone else has a headlamp on his forehead like a miner. The lobby is full of warm bodies. The air is thick. It smells like wet jackets and vanilla and the faint tang of diesel.

Mara opens the front door and lets in a wash of cold rain. The air moves. The flames in the candles flutter. A few people complain in half-hearted tones.

"Close it," someone says. "It's freezing." He is wrapped in a blanket and looks like a burrito with opinions.

"We need air," Mara says, and it comes out too sharp. She softens her voice. "Just for a minute." She tries to sound reasonable, the way she does in her videos. Do this, not that, easy fix. A smiley face at the end.

The receptionist appears from behind the desk, phone pressed to his ear. He covers the mouthpiece. "We can't," he says. "Rain. Security." He gestures at the wet floor like it's a sin. He doesn't look at her. He doesn't want a conversation.

Mara holds the door open a second longer, feeling the cold on her face. The rain is real and stinging. It makes her eyes water. It smells like wet stone. She lets the door close, and the warm, thick air wraps around her again like a blanket she doesn't want.

She looks at the detector on the wall by the lobby window, the one she has been nodding at like a talisman. Up close, she can see the sticker on its face. SMOKE ONLY. The words are small and neat, printed in the kind of font used for rules nobody reads. Mara feels a flare of anger, sharp and immediate, like a burn.

She touches the plastic, as if that will change it. It blinks green. It does not care that it is the wrong kind of guardian.

"Is there a carbon monoxide detector?" she asks the receptionist when he ends his call. She hears the edge in her voice and tries to sand it down.

He blinks, confused. "That is the alarm," he says, pointing to the wall.

"It says smoke only." She holds her phone up with the flashlight so he can see the sticker. He leans in, squints, then shrugs.

"We have alarm," he says. "It's fine." He repeats the phrase like a charm that wards off complaints.

Mara feels a grim, humorless laugh rise in her throat. It's fine has become a national motto at this point, printed on souvenirs and stitched into the air. She swallows it. She doesn't have energy for a fight with a tired man in a dark lobby.

She goes to the kitchen for a glass of water. The kitchen is quieter than earlier, but still warm with the residual heat of cooking. The windows are fogged. A printed sign on the wall says PLEASE DO NOT USE GAS STOVE DURING OUTAGES. Someone has drawn a little frowny face underneath it with a marker. The microwave blinks 12:00 in green, mocking her.

She fills a glass and takes a sip. The water tastes faintly of bleach and metal. She sets the glass down and catches her reflection in the dark window. Her face looks pale, her lips too pink. The color looks wrong in the candlelight. She turns away.

As she leaves the kitchen, she hears a soft beep. It's not her detector. It's the handheld one the inspector used earlier, a memory beep. It might be a phone. It might be a timer. It might be the building itself. She listens for a second beep. It doesn't come.

She drifts toward the back hallway and the patio door. The generator's hum is loudest here, vibrating through the tile. She pushes the door open and steps into the small courtyard under the plastic canopy. The rain is loud on the plastic, a constant drum. The generator sits against the wall, trembling, its engine casing slick with condensation. The exhaust pipe points toward the wall and the exhaust curls back under the canopy, lazy and gray.

A staff member sits on a plastic chair nearby, hood up, scrolling his phone with one hand and smoking with the other. The cigarette smoke mixes with the exhaust, a cocktail of bad decisions. He looks at Mara as if she is a ghost or a nuisance. He doesn't move.

"Shouldn't the pipe go out?" Mara asks. She gestures to the wall. Her breath puffs in the damp air.

He shrugs, the universal gesture of not my problem. "Outside," he says. He taps the plastic canopy with his knuckle as if the word outside still applies. "Rain." He shakes his head at the weather, as if the rain is what makes this dangerous.

Mara looks up at the canopy. Water pools in the middle, sagging like a belly. The sides are closed with clear plastic to keep the rain out. The air is trapped. The exhaust is trapped. She thinks about the warning on the Wi-Fi portal: USE COMMON ROOM ONLY. She thinks about how many common rooms can fit under a plastic roof.

"It's not really outside," she says, but her voice is small now. She can taste the exhaust on her tongue. It is sweet and oily, like a bad candle.

He takes a drag of his cigarette and exhales. "We have to run it," he says. "Power." He points toward the building with the cigarette like it's his only argument.

Mara wants to say that power isn't worth poisoned air. She wants to say that they could move the generator to the street, that they could vent it properly. She wants to say anything that would make her feel like she is not complicit. Instead she says, "Okay," because it is the word she uses when she feels small.

She stands there for a moment, watching the exhaust curl and then disappear. The generator hums, tireless and indifferent. The rain hammers the canopy. The staff member scrolls and smokes. The world keeps running on small engines and small lies.

She turns and goes back inside. The air in the hallway feels thicker now, as if the courtyard air clings to her clothes and follows her. She walks past a closed door and hears snoring. She walks past another door and hears a cough, wet and deep. The sounds make her skin prickle.

Back in her room, Hannah is still asleep. Mara closes the door and leans against it for a moment. Her head feels heavy. Her arms feel too light. She presses her palm to the wall and feels a faint warmth, as if the building has its own body heat.

She checks the detector. Green. It blinks, patient and unbothered. She presses the test button again and it beeps. She knows it's just a test. She knows it doesn't mean safety. She can't stop herself.

She sits on the edge of the bed and thinks about waking Hannah, about pulling her out into the rain again. She imagines Hannah's face, the tired line of her mouth, the way she said you don't have to do this again. She imagines the argument. She imagines herself being the villain who ruins everyone else's sleep. She is too tired to be that person.

She lies down and watches the green light blink. One. Two. Three. It is easier to count than to think.

---

At 3:07 a.m., the power flickers back on.

The ceiling fan lurches, then spins. The heater under the window clicks and hums. The light over the sink in the bathroom flares, too bright in the darkness. The generator hum outside doesn't stop, not immediately. It winds down slowly, like a long breath. The room fills with the low whir of electricity returning, the kind of sound that makes you think things are normal again.

Mara sits up as if she has been waiting for it. Her heart is thudding. The air still tastes sweet. The fan pushes it around, turning it into a draft that feels somehow worse.

Hannah wakes with a soft groan. "Power?" she murmurs, rubbing her eyes.

"Yeah," Mara says. "It came back." She doesn't say anything else.

The lights stay on for four minutes and then flicker out again. The fan stops mid-spin. The room goes still. The generator hum starts up again, lower and heavier, as if irritated by the interruption. The light of the detector remains steady, green, a tiny, stubborn eye.

Hannah sighs and turns over. "It's fine," she says into her pillow, a mantra in the dark. "We'll leave in the morning. You'll feel better when we're gone." Her voice is muffled. She is already halfway back to sleep.

Mara watches her and feels a sour knot of guilt. She wants to be the person who lets her friend sleep. She wants to be the person who doesn't turn everything into a crisis. She wants to be the person who doesn't think about air. She is not that person anymore.

She reaches for her phone and scrolls through messages in the dark, a ritual she hates. There is another new one from another blank account, as if the internet is also awake and breathing. This one is a photo.

A hallway. A door. A green blinking dot under it. The angle is wrong for her room, but not wrong for this floor. The caption reads: DOORS DON'T HELP.

Her stomach drops. She checks the time stamp. One minute ago. She sits up straighter, the room suddenly too small. The photo could be anywhere. It could be a prank. It could be someone on this floor, walking the same hallway, taking pictures of the same green dots. It could be nothing. It could be everything.

She blocks the account. Her hands are shaking. The green light on her detector blinks and blinks and does nothing to make her feel safe.

She gets up and locks the door, as if a lock could stop air. She presses her ear to the wood. She listens. The hallway is quiet except for the faint hum and the rain.

She goes to the bathroom and splashes water on her face. The water is cold. She looks in the mirror. Her eyes are wide. Her lips look too pink again. She bares her teeth at her reflection, a grimace, a laugh without sound.

"You wanted a content break," she whispers to the mirror. "Congratulations." The line lands like a joke that only she gets.

She opens the bathroom window, the tiny one above the shower. It barely cracks, a sliver. Cold air slips in, wet and sharp. It is not enough to matter, but she does it anyway because doing something feels better than doing nothing.

She returns to bed and lies down on top of the blanket. She keeps her phone in her hand, the screen dark. The hum continues. The rain continues. Her head throbs, and the throb has started to feel familiar, like a companion she didn't invite.

She thinks about her followers, about the posts she hasn't made, about the promise she keeps giving her mother and never quite keeping: I'm okay. She thinks about how the truth would sound if she said it out loud. I'm breathing, but I don't trust it. I'm safe, but only because the light is still green. I'm tired, but sleep feels like giving up.

She smiles, a small, grim smile at the absurdity of that last thought. It sounds like a tagline for a horror movie about insomnia. It sounds like the kind of thing she would have mocked in the comments.

She closes her eyes anyway. Sleep comes in thin layers, not quite dreams, not quite waking. In one, she is back in the old hostel room with the heater, watching the blue flame. In another, she is walking through a hallway lined with doors, each door breathing in and out. In another, she is holding her detector over a sleeping crowd, waiting for it to scream.

She wakes with a jerk when the detector chirps once. A single, small beep. She sits up, heart racing. The green light blinks. It does not alarm. She presses the test button. The beeps are loud and sharp. She lets go. The beeps stop. The green light blinks, as if nothing happened.

She stares at it. She hates the uncertainty, the way the thing she bought to be a guardian is also a mystery. She thinks about batteries, about the pharmacy with no AAs, about the note on the counter. She thinks about the manual in the box and whether she even read the right section. The beep could mean low battery. It could mean malfunction. It could mean it smelled something and then lost interest.

She sits back, deflated. She is too tired to check the manual now. She is too tired to do anything useful. She watches the green light blink and lets her eyes close again.

---

In the early hours, the rain eases to a mist. The hum continues anyway.

Mara drifts in and out of sleep, each waking a small shock. At one point she thinks she hears a door slam and someone curse in the hallway. At another, she thinks she hears Hannah say her name. She doesn't know which is real. Her dreams are made of sounds and smells now, each one an echo of the night.

When she opens her eyes for the last time, the window is pale with morning. The rain has left beads on the glass. The room is quiet. The generator hum is gone. The fan is still. The green light blinks on her nightstand, steady and calm.

She sits up slowly, head heavy. The metallic taste is stronger now, like she has been licking batteries in her sleep. Her mouth is dry. Her tongue feels thick. She swallows and feels a faint nausea rise.

Hannah is still asleep. Her breathing is deep and even. Mara watches her for a moment, checking the rise and fall of her chest like a monitor. She doesn't like who she's becoming, the person who scans the people she loves for symptoms. She is tired of being that person. She is also terrified of stopping.

She swings her legs over the side of the bed and stands. The floor feels too far away. She steadies herself on the bed frame. A moment of dizziness passes, slow and syrupy. She waits for her vision to sharpen. It does, eventually.

She reaches for the oxygen can and gives herself a short hiss. The cold air hits her throat and makes her cough. She coughs again, a dry, irritated sound that feels too loud in the small room. Hannah stirs and rolls over, half awake.

"Morning?" Hannah mumbles.

"Yeah," Mara says. "It's morning." She doesn't say how many times she's had to wake to get there.

Hannah sits up, hair sticking out in damp curls. "Power's on?" she asks.

"I think so," Mara says. She doesn't trust her own voice. She reaches for her phone and sees the time: 6:21 a.m. The bus is at seven. The bus is always at seven until it isn't.

She stands by the window and opens it all the way. The air outside is cold and gray, damp with morning. It smells like wet street and bread. She breathes it in and feels the metallic taste soften, just slightly. The relief is a small, sharp thing that makes her want to cry.

"We should go early," she says. "Before the power cuts again." It comes out too intense, the kind of sentence that makes people look at you funny.

Hannah nods without arguing. She swings her feet to the floor. "Okay," she says. "Let's go." She says it like it's a promise. She says it like she believes it.

Mara closes her bag with hands that feel clumsy. She grabs the detector and hesitates. She wants to leave it behind, to stop being the person who carries a blinking light like a talisman. She puts it in her hoodie pocket anyway. She can feel its weight against her chest, a small, hard reassurance.

They move quietly through the hallway, stepping around other sleepers. The lobby is empty, the candles burnt down to stubs. The front door is closed. The air in the lobby smells less sweet now, more like damp coats and yesterday's coffee. The wall detector blinks its green light, smoke only. She doesn't look at it.

At the door, she pauses and looks back at the staircase, the yellow light at the end of the hall. She thinks about the hum, about the canopy, about the exhaust curling back on itself. She thinks about the message that said doors don't help. She thinks about the door she is about to open.

She steps out into the morning rain. The air is cold enough to make her eyes water. It feels like a slap. She welcomes it.

The street is quiet, slick with rain. The bakery is already awake, the warm smell drifting into the gray. A stray dog trots past, tail low, sniffing the wet curb. The city looks peaceful, as if it didn't keep her awake all night.

Hannah walks beside her, sleepy but steady. They head toward the bus stop. Mara's head still aches. Her mouth still tastes like metal. The detector in her pocket blinks against her ribs.

Behind them, the hostel door clicks shut. The building settles. The hum, in her imagination, starts again.

She walks faster. She tells herself she is leaving. She tells herself she is safe now that she is moving. The words feel thin in the morning air, like breath that doesn't quite fog the glass.

When she reaches the corner, she sees the bus station down the street, a low concrete block under a sky the color of tin. She thinks about the last message, the photo of a door and a green dot. She thinks about who took it.

She turns to Hannah and opens her mouth to say something she isn't ready to say. The words stick. She swallows them and keeps walking.

The morning smells like wet bread and diesel. The air feels clean. The taste of pennies stays.
