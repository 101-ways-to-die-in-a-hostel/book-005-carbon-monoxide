# Chapter 14: The Morning That Won't Start

Hannah knocks three times and Mara still can't remember how to open her eyes.

The sound is ordinary, a familiar rhythm on a cheap door, but it arrives from far away, like she's hearing it through a pillow. She blinks. The room wobbles. The fan above her makes slow, lazy circles, and the movement makes her nauseous in a way that feels cartoonish, like the room is a spinny ride she can't get off.

"Mara?" Hannah's voice is muffled. She knocks again. "We have to go if we're catching the seven."

The seven. The 7 a.m. bus she booked last night like a promise. The confirmation email is still open on her laptop, the cheery subject line glaring at her: Your Adventure Awaits! The adventure is currently her trying to sit up without the room tilting.

"I'm up," she says, and it sounds like she's talking through a scarf.

She swings her legs over the side of the bed. The floor is cold. Her feet find the tiles and it feels like stepping onto a moon that is slightly farther away than it should be. Her mouth tastes like pennies. Her head is a dense, dull weight. She touches her forehead as if she can lift it off.

She stands. The world flashes white for a second. She grips the bed frame and waits for her vision to come back. It does, grudgingly, like a sullen friend.

She is leaving today. She repeats it to herself like a mantra. Leaving is the only thing she has control over.

She brushes her teeth and gags on the mint. The mint does nothing to cover the metallic taste. The mirror shows a girl with damp hair and eyes that look too bright in the early light. She looks like she has been crying. She hasn't. The pink in her lips looks fake, the way a filter looks fake when you see it in daylight.

Her phone buzzes in her pocket. She pulls it out, expecting another blank message. It's a text from the hostel manager at the old place. Short. "Police need statement. Please call." It has a number. It has an apology emoji like that makes it soft.

Mara stares at the screen. The bus leaves in forty minutes. The police want a statement. Her head wants to be a pillow. She thinks about all the people in the waiting room with the too-pink lips and the oxygen tanks, and she feels a surge of guilt. She thinks about leaving the city without saying anything, and it feels like a theft.

Hannah knocks again. "Five minutes," she calls.

"Yeah," Mara says, and the word feels like a borrowed coat.

She dials the number. It rings twice.

"Hola," a man's voice says, brisk and official.

She switches to English. "I stayed at the hostel. Room nine. I left before the leak, but I was there." She hears herself. She hears the way her voice shakes.

The man asks her to come to the station for a statement. He says it like a routine request, which it probably is. He says there were more people hospitalized overnight. He says they need names for the report. He says, "It is not long." He says it in the same way people say "just a minute" when they mean twenty.

Mara looks at the bus time on her laptop. Forty minutes is not long either. It is also everything.

"We can go later," Hannah says when she hears the end of the call. She is already by the door, backpack on, hair damp, her body a picture of readiness. "The statement matters. Another bus leaves at two."

Mara wants to say no. She wants to say she is leaving now and never looking back. She wants to say that waiting until two feels like inviting the city to keep her. Instead she says, "Okay," because Hannah is right and because she is too tired to fight a moral argument.

Hannah texts the bus company and reschedules. The app makes it look easy, like travel is a video game with undo buttons.

They walk to the police station with the kind of slow, damp determination that makes a city feel like a maze. The air is wet and cold. The street smells of fried dough and exhaust. Every time a bus sighs by, Mara flinches at the smell of diesel. It is a different smell than the heater, but it is still a smell that means breathing isn't always clean.

The station is a beige building with metal chairs lined up like a low-budget waiting room. A television in the corner plays a morning show with silent laughter. The screen flickers, the sound off, the host's smile frozen in a loop. It feels like a warning in a different genre.

A man in a uniform gives Mara a form in Spanish. Hannah sits beside her, translating in a low voice. Name. Passport. Room number. Dates. Symptoms. Mara writes with a pen that scratches, her hand shaking slightly on each line. The word room feels heavy. The number nine feels heavier.

An officer takes her into a small office and asks questions that are both clinical and too personal. Did you smell gas? Did you see the heater? Was the window open? Did you feel unwell? Mara answers. Yes, yes, yes, yes. The repetition feels like confession.

He asks about the taped vents. She describes the silver tape, the way it shone. He writes it down without looking up. He asks about the detector. She tells him there was a box on the wall in the lobby with tape over it, the red light dead. She tells him she found a detector in her desk drawer with no battery. He writes it down, the pen moving faster now.

"You were in room nine," he says, and his tone shifts. It is not accusatory. It is just a fact that lands like a weight. "We found the highest readings in nine and ten. The heater vent was blocked. The staff said guests had been opening windows."

"We did," Mara says. She hears the defensiveness and hates it. "I did."

He nods. "That may have helped." He looks at her face. "You should get checked again if symptoms continue. Carbon monoxide can stay in your blood. It can move to the brain." He says it in the same tone as the clinic, calm and careful, but the words are different. They paint a picture she doesn't want.

Mara tries to swallow. Her mouth tastes like metal. She nods, because nodding is the safest action in a room with badges.

When they leave the station, the sky has gone from gray to a thin, pale blue. The city looks like it is trying to be kind. The air still feels too thick in her lungs.

Hannah buys her a pastry from a cart outside, a little round thing filled with cheese. The vendor presses it into Mara's hand with a smile. It is warm and greasy and should be comforting. The grease sits on her tongue like a film. The cheese tastes like nothing.

"You should eat," Hannah says. "You haven't had anything." Her voice is firm in the way of someone who has seen enough dehydration to know what it looks like.

Mara chews because Hannah is right. The texture feels wrong. The taste doesn't land. She swallows anyway.

"We can go to the clinic again," Hannah says. "Just to be sure." She is trying to keep her voice light, but the word sure is weighted.

Mara wants to say no. She wants to say she is tired of being told she's fine. She wants to say she is tired of rooms that smell like bleach and waiting rooms that smell like fear. But the officer's words are still in her head, the quiet certainty of it: it can move to the brain.

"Okay," she says again. It is the word she keeps using when she doesn't want to decide.

The clinic is busier than yesterday. The waiting room is full of people from the old hostel, if the pale faces and the heavy eyes are any indication. A girl with a beanie sits with her head in her hands. A guy with a man bun leans against the wall, eyes closed, his chest rising and falling like he's trying to remember how.

Mara and Hannah take seats by the wall. The chair is hard. The air is warm. The television plays the same morning show without sound. The host's smile looks like a mask.

Mara recognizes the man from the old hostel stairwell, the one who called it altitude. He sits two chairs away with a plastic bag of crackers and a wristband around his wrist. He looks at her, recognition flickering, then he looks away quickly, as if eye contact would confirm something neither of them wants to name.

The nurse calls her name. The same clip goes on her finger. The numbers blink. Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine. The numbers are clean and perfect, a lie told in a bright digital font.

"We can do a blood test," the nurse says this time. "For carboxyhemoglobin. It will tell us if there is still carbon monoxide in your blood." She says the word carefully, like it is a mouthful of nails.

Mara nods. The nurse swabs her arm and draws blood. The vial fills with a dark, glossy red that looks too alive. She watches it, fascinated and nauseous at once. Her body is a bag of secrets.

While they wait for results, the doctor offers her oxygen again. She takes it. The mask is cold. The hiss is steady. The room fades at the edges. She lets herself sink into it. The relief is immediate and humiliating. It feels good in the way a forbidden snack feels good, the kind that tastes like you know you shouldn't need it.

Hannah sits beside her, hand on her knee, a quiet anchor. She scrolls her phone with her other hand, stopping every so often to glance at Mara. Mara can feel the watchfulness like heat.

"You doing okay?" Hannah asks.

"It feels like cheating," Mara says, and it comes out as a joke. She is not sure what she is joking about. Her body? The air? The idea that a hose can fix anything?

Hannah gives a short laugh. "Good. Cheating is underrated."

The blood test comes back faster than Mara expects. The doctor returns with a printed sheet and a look that tries to be neutral. "It is low," he says. "Not dangerous now. But it shows exposure. You are right to rest and to leave the city. It will clear with oxygen and time. Do not sleep in rooms with gas. Avoid smoke." He pauses. "And no alcohol."

The word exposure sits in Mara's mouth. It is small and scientific and it makes her feel both validated and scared. Low but real. Proof that the air in room nine got into her, that the taste in her mouth has a name.

She thanks the doctor and takes the paper as if she is being handed a receipt for her own body. The nurse gives her another packet of ibuprofen. Hannah pays. They leave the clinic with a bag of pills and a printout that says what she already knew.

Outside, the afternoon light is sharp. The city smells like frying oil and wet stone. The air feels almost clean, which makes her angry because it doesn't make her feel better.

They walk toward the taxi stand and end up on the street with the old hostel because the city is a tangle of shortcuts and bad timing. The building is there like a bruise you keep finding with your tongue. The door is shut. Yellow tape crisscrosses the frame. A paper sign in Spanish is taped to the glass: CERRADO HASTA NUEVO AVISO. Closed until further notice. The words are bland. They don't mention the word monóxido.

Two men in uniforms stand by the entrance, one with the same black case she saw in the new hostel. He holds the handheld detector at chest height and scans the doorway as if the air might still be hiding. The device beeps softly. He frowns at the screen and shakes his head. The other man writes on a clipboard, the same steady motion she saw yesterday. A portable fan is jammed in the open transom window, its cord snaking out across the wet wall. The fan whirs, pushing air out of the building like an exhale that won't stop.

On the sidewalk, a small pile of luggage sits in a wet heap, tagged with paper labels. A pink duffel, a dented suitcase, a backpack with a rain cover. The pile looks like it belongs to people who left in a hurry. A woman in a neon vest stands beside it with a list, calling names. A young man in a hoodie steps forward and takes a black bag. He looks stunned, like he woke up in the wrong story.

Mara's stomach tightens. She realizes, with a jolt, that there are still people whose things are in that building. She imagines her own backpack sitting there, her cables and tripod and light ring waiting in a pile for someone to claim them. The image makes her dizzy.

\"Let's keep moving,\" Hannah says. Her hand touches Mara's elbow. The touch is gentle but firm, the way you move someone away from a cliff without saying the word cliff.

Mara nods and doesn't move. She can't stop watching. A man in a puffy jacket leans against the wall, phone pressed to his ear. He is speaking Spanish rapidly, the words blurring into a stream of worry. He ends the call and stares at the taped door. He wipes his face with his sleeve. It looks like rain. It might not be.

A woman with a camera and a badge around her neck steps up to the tape. She lifts the camera and takes a photo of the door, the tape, the fan. She spots Mara and Hannah and moves toward them with that slight forward lean of someone who wants a quote.

\"Were you staying here?\" she asks in English. Her voice is bright, practiced. \"Do you have a comment?\"\n
Mara opens her mouth and nothing comes out. She thinks about her channel, about talking into a camera being her job. She thinks about the word comment and how it makes tragedy sound like a YouTube thread.

\"We already gave a statement,\" Hannah says. She steps between Mara and the camera. The woman nods, unfazed, and moves on, already scanning for someone else.

Mara exhales. Her breath feels thin. The metallic taste in her mouth sharpens. She looks at the taped door and the fan and the pile of bags and feels, absurdly, left behind. She is not part of this story anymore. She is also in it up to her knees.

On the wall beside the door, someone has taped up a handwritten note in blue marker: PLEASE CHECK ON YOUR FRIENDS. The letters are smeared from rain. The message is simple and it makes her want to cry. She thinks about all the anonymous accounts messaging her, and how the real warning has been on a wall the whole time.

Hannah squeezes her arm again. Mara finally turns away.

The bus station is across town. They take a taxi because the buses are crowded and Mara's head is a slow drum. The taxi smells like pine air freshener and old cigarettes. The driver hums to the radio. Mara watches the street slide by through the fog of the window.

The station is a cavern of motion and noise, the kind of place where you lose yourself just by stepping inside. Vendors call out for snacks. People drag suitcases across dirty tile. The air smells of diesel and fried plantains. It is the opposite of clean.

At the ticket window, the woman shakes her head. "Two o'clock bus canceled," she says in Spanish. Hannah translates. "There is a protest on the highway. Maybe four. Maybe tomorrow." She says it with the same casual shrug the receptionist at the old hostel used when he taped over the alarm.

Mara stares at the woman as if staring could change the answer. Her head aches. Her mouth tastes like metal. Her body feels heavy. Leaving is not a button you can press. It is a line you have to find an opening through.

"Is there another company?" Mara asks, and hears the desperation in her own voice. The woman gestures vaguely toward a row of other windows and says something about schedules. The other windows are lines and closed signs and people shrugging. The whole station has the soft chaos of a missed connection: little clusters of travelers staring at screens, a child sleeping on a pile of jackets, a man arguing into his phone in a language she can't place. It all feels like a stalled machine, everyone waiting for the gear to catch.

Mara sits on a plastic chair while Hannah checks other counters. The chair is warm from the person who sat there before her. The warmth is a ghost. She watches a family spread out food on a blanket on the floor and thinks, with a flicker of dark humor, that at least they're picnicking in a bus station instead of a hospital. She presses her tongue to the back of her teeth and tastes pennies again. The taste follows her everywhere, like a bad subtitle she can't turn off.

"We can stay another night," Hannah says gently. "We'll leave tomorrow. It's fine." She is trying to be calm, trying to keep Mara from breaking. The word fine lands like a small slap.

Mara wants to scream. She wants to punch the ticket window and yell at the city for trapping her. She says, "Okay," again, because it is the only word she has left.

They go back to the hostel with their bags still packed. The bread smell from the bakery next door is stronger in the afternoon heat, a warm, soft sweetness that makes the air feel safer than it deserves to be. Mara inhales it and still tastes pennies.

In the lobby, the receptionist with the nose ring looks up and reads her face. "Bus canceled?" she asks.

Mara nods. It feels like failure. The receptionist gestures at the couch. "You want tea?"

"Water," Mara says, because water is all she can stand to promise.

She sits on the couch and watches the green dot on the detector blink. It blinks and blinks like a heartbeat that never gets tired. She realizes she is timing her breathing to it again. She stops, annoyed with herself. She cannot control the air with her lungs. She can only be in it.

Hannah goes upstairs to drop her bag. Mara stays in the lobby and scrolls her phone. There is a new message in her inbox. A blank account. Three words.

Not done yet.

She stares at the screen. Her heart speeds up. The message is probably a troll, a bored person watching the news and playing games, but it lands like a weight. She blocks the account. The screen confirms the block. The message still echoes in her head.

She walks to the pharmacy across the street and buys another oxygen can because the empty one rattling in her bag feels like a betrayal. The pharmacist gives her a look and doesn't ask questions. She also buys a cheap carbon monoxide detector because the boxes have been haunting her for days and she needs to do something, anything, that feels like a defense.

Back in her room, she opens the detector box. The plastic is thin. The instructions are too many languages for something that should be simple. It says to place it on the wall or on a table, to test it weekly, to never cover it. It has a little diagram of a smiling house. The smile looks smug.

She inserts the battery. The detector chirps, a sharp, startling beep that makes her heart jump. She laughs, a short, breathy sound. The beep is the kind of sound she has been waiting for and fearing. It is a small alarm in a clean room, and it makes her feel absurdly safer.

She sets it on the nightstand and presses the test button. It beeps in a quick pattern, a tiny insistence. The sound is loud in the small room. The fan hums. The window is open. The air moves. Everything is fine and still she can feel the dread hovering at the edges, like a shadow that follows even in daylight.

She lies down on the bed with her shoes still on. The day has wrung her out. Her head aches in a low, stubborn line. The printed blood test paper sits on the desk, a receipt for a hazard she cannot see. She closes her eyes.

She sleeps for twenty minutes. She wakes with her heart racing, the taste of metal thicker. She sits up. The detector on the nightstand blinks green. She watches it blink. She tells herself it is the only honest light in her life right now.

Hannah knocks and comes in with soup and bread. "You need to eat," she says.

"I already had a greasy pastry," Mara says. She tries to make it a joke. It doesn't land.

"That doesn't count," Hannah says. She hands her a spoon. Her voice is gentle and firm. Mara eats because she is too tired to fight.

The soup tastes like garlic and salt. The garlic cuts through the metal for a moment. It is a small victory. She holds it close and lets it pass through her.

"We're leaving tomorrow," Hannah says. "No matter what." She says it like a vow. Mara nods. She wants to believe in it. She wants to believe in a calendar again.

Later, when Hannah goes to shower, Mara sits by the window and watches the street. The rain has started again, a soft hiss on the pavement. A bus goes by with its windows fogged. The bakery next door pulls a tray of rolls from the oven. The smell drifts up in warm waves. The city is doing its normal things. It is Mara who feels abnormal.

Her phone buzzes with a message from her mother. "Any update?" it says. Mara types, "Saw a doctor. Mild exposure. Leaving tomorrow. I'm ok." She adds a heart because it's easier than explaining.

She opens her camera app and looks at herself. The lighting in the room is late afternoon gray. She looks tired. She looks real. She thinks about filming a post, about turning the last three days into content, a cautionary tale with a soft voice and a list of tips. She thinks about the comments, the sympathy, the way people could take her story and fold it into their own fears. She closes the app. She isn't ready to be a public service announcement. She is still a person with a headache and a green blinking light on her nightstand.

The detector chirps once, a single quick beep. Mara's head snaps up. The light is still green. The beep doesn't repeat. She sits very still and listens. Nothing. The fan hums. The rain ticks against the window. The hallway is quiet.

She tells herself it was the test button being sensitive, a low battery, a glitch. She tells herself the same thing she has been telling herself about everything: that it is probably nothing.

The word probably has become her religion.

Her phone buzzes again. Another blank account. Two words this time.

You carry it.

She stares at the message. She feels the air move across her face. She can taste metal on her tongue. She looks at the detector blinking green, the only honest light, and wonders if it can detect a thing inside her blood.

She turns the phone face down. She turns the detector so she can see the green light without lifting her head. She lies back on the bed and lets the fan push air over her face. She counts her breaths in the rhythm of the blinking dot. One. Two. Three. The numbers feel like a spell.

Outside, a siren wails and fades. Inside, the detector blinks and the fan hums and Mara waits for sleep to take her. She does not trust sleep anymore, but she does not have the energy to do anything else.

In the dark, she tells herself she will leave in the morning. She tells herself the city cannot keep her. She tells herself that the air in her lungs is her own.

The green light blinks, patient and steady, and the taste of pennies does not fade.
