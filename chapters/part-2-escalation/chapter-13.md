# Chapter 13: The Number That Lies

The clip on her finger says ninety-nine and Mara feels like she's drowning.

She stares at the tiny screen in the clinic and wants to laugh, because ninety-nine is a perfect number, a grade her mother used to put on the fridge, a number that means you are safe. The plastic clamp squeezes her finger with a polite, firm insistence. The nurse smiles as if the screen is the only story there is.

"See?" the nurse says. "Very good." She peels the clip away and returns to her desk, where a phone is ringing that never stops ringing.

Mara nods as if she understands. She does not say that her head still feels like it's packed with wet cotton, that her tongue still tastes like old coins, that her body feels too heavy for the chair. She does not say that oxygen numbers can lie, because the last time she tried to say that the pharmacist looked at her like she was making up a problem to make herself feel important.

She says, "Okay," which is the word people use when they want a conversation to end without admitting anything. The nurse gives her a small cup of water anyway. It tastes like chlorine and reassurance.

Hannah sits across from her, scrolling through her phone. She looks up every so often, her eyes measuring Mara's face. The clinic room is small and overlit, a rectangle of white walls and a poster of lungs that are pink and clean in a way real lungs never are. A little fan rattles on the ceiling, pushing warm air down like a tired hand.

Mara has been awake since five. Her brain has been running since five-thirty. At five-forty, she read the news article she hadn't been able to load last night. The Wi-Fi portal finally let it through between ads for tours. The headline was worse in English.

HOSTEL GAS LEAK HOSPITALIZES FOUR. ONE CRITICAL.

There was a photo of the old building, the same door, the same damp wall. The door looked smaller in the frame, like a child version of itself. She read the article twice and then a third time, waiting for her name to appear. It did not. That should have been a relief. It felt like a threat.

She took a screenshot and sent it to her mother with a calm line. "I left before this. I'm okay." She did not mention the taste in her mouth or the pounding in her head. She did not mention that she woke up with a heartbeat like a stuck engine. She did not mention that she spent five minutes lying still, counting her breaths, and couldn't remember if she got to ten.

Hannah said they should go to a clinic anyway. Mara said it was just altitude, and Hannah said, "Maybe. But let's have someone tell you that in person." That is how you win an argument with Mara: make it about being reasonable.

The clinic smells like alcohol wipes and damp coats. A man in a poncho sits in the corner and coughs into his elbow. A woman holds a toddler who is squirming with the kind of energy Mara cannot imagine possessing right now. The walls are lined with motivational posters about hydration. Everyone is silent in the particular way people are silent when they are waiting to be told they are fine.

The doctor comes in with a clipboard and a tired face. He speaks English as if it is something he learned from textbooks and needed to use in emergencies. He asks Mara about symptoms. She lists them: headache, nausea, dizziness, tingling fingers. He nods and writes. He asks if she has been drinking. She says no. He asks if she has been sleeping. She says not well. He nods and writes again.

"Altitude," he says, as if the word is a stamp he can press over any complaint. He gestures at the poster of the pink lungs. "And maybe stress." He says the word with the softness of someone pretending it isn't an insult.

Mara wants to explain the old hostel, the heater, the tape, the sweet smell, the body on the stretcher. She wants to say the word monóxido and watch his face change. She wants to be believed.

"I was near a gas leak," she says instead, and her voice is too quiet. She pushes it louder. "At another hostel." She expects him to look up sharply. He does not.

"Do you have shortness of breath?" he asks.

"I don't know," she says, and that is the truth.

He checks her lungs with a cold stethoscope and listens like he is counting. He nods again. "We can give you oxygen. It will help if there was exposure. But your saturation is good. No need for hospital unless you faint." He says this in the exact tone Mara uses in her videos when she tells people not to panic about a lost phone: direct, calm, slightly condescending.

She wants to laugh, because she is sitting in a clinic being offered oxygen, like some kind of budget spa treatment, and the irony is almost funny. She wants to say, I have been huffing canned air like it is a ritual. She doesn't.

She accepts the oxygen.

They move her to a chair in a small room with three other chairs and a metal rack of tanks. The oxygen mask smells faintly of rubber and antiseptic. When she puts it on, the world gets louder. The hiss is steady, a soft serpent sound that makes her chest unclench. The air is cold and thin and perfect. It feels like being on the top of a mountain without the view.

Hannah sits beside her on a plastic chair and scrolls through her phone in a way that tries to look casual and fails. Mara's phone buzzes in her pocket. She doesn't look at it. She watches the clear tube loop from the tank to her face and thinks about how ridiculous it is that a hose can feel like salvation.

After ten minutes, her headache loosens. After twenty, the nausea stops rising like a tide. After thirty, she feels almost normal, which is its own kind of betrayal. The oxygen makes her believe in quick fixes again, and that belief makes her want to cry.

When they unhook her, she sways a little. The nurse smiles. "You see?" she says again. "Altitude. You are fine. Drink water, no alcohol, rest. Call us if worse." She says it in a tone that implies calling is unlikely.

They pay at the desk. The receptionist hands Mara a receipt and a tiny packet of ibuprofen. The total is less than a tourist brunch. The cheapness makes it feel less real.

On the way out, Mara sees a young man sitting in the waiting room, his face pale, his eyes too glossy. He is the one from the stairs yesterday, the one who called it altitude. He is slumped in a chair with his backpack at his feet, and there is a band around his wrist like a hospital tag. His friend stands beside him, holding a plastic bag with a bagel inside, as if carbs could fix this. He looks at Mara and squints, as if recognizing her from somewhere, and then his eyes slide away.

Mara feels the sick urge to apologize, as if she is responsible for the air in someone else's lungs.

Outside, the rain has gone from a steady sheet to a soft mist. The city smells like wet stone and coffee. The air feels cleaner than it did yesterday, which is probably in her head but still a relief. She draws in a deep breath and lets it go slowly, like she is testing the world for cracks.

Hannah buys a cup of coffee from a street vendor and hands it to her. "For your headache," she says. "Or your soul. Whatever." The cup is warm against Mara's fingers. The smell is bitter and grounded. She sips and tastes only coffee. For a moment, the pennies disappear.

Her phone buzzes again. She checks it now, because if she doesn't it will keep nagging at the edge of her mind. A new message from an unknown account. No profile photo. The same blankness as before.

The message says: How is your breathing?

She stops walking. Hannah keeps moving for a step before noticing. She turns back, sees Mara's face, and frowns. "Another one?"

Mara nods. She doesn't show her the screen. She doesn't want to give it weight. She types nothing. She blocks the account. She knows it won't matter, because there are infinite blank accounts in the universe, like there are infinite bad smells in an old building. She puts her phone away and keeps walking.

"Maybe we should leave Quito early," Hannah says. She says it gently, like she's offering a soft landing.

"Maybe," Mara says. She tells herself that agreeing is practical. It isn't. It is relief with a passport stamp.

They walk back to the new hostel with their hoods up. The bakery next door is open now, and the smell of bread drifts into the street. It is the kind of smell that makes people decide to have another piece, as if the smell itself is an argument. Mara breathes it and tastes bread, not metal. She tries to let that be enough.

In the lobby, the receptionist with the nose ring is talking to two men in uniforms. The men are not police, but they have the posture of people who are used to being obeyed. One has a clipboard. The other holds a black case with a little handle. A portable detector? It looks like a lunchbox.

Mara freezes. The receptionist notices her and gives a small wave, the kind that says, it's fine, but it isn't.

"We are checking all hostels in the area," one of the men says, in careful English. "Routine. Do you have any gas heaters here?"

"No," the receptionist says. "All electric." She points toward the ceiling. The man with the clipboard checks a box.

He looks at Mara. "Did you stay at the other hostel?" he asks. His tone is neutral. The question is not.

Mara's mouth goes dry. She can taste pennies again. "Yes," she says. It comes out too fast.

"We might need a statement," he says. "There was a leak. Some guests were affected. If you have symptoms, you should see a doctor." He says it the way people say you should drink water, as if it is common sense and not an accusation.

"I did," she says, and the words feel like a shield. She lifts her pharmacy bag slightly, a visual prop. The man nods, satisfied.

He opens the black case and pulls out a handheld device with a digital screen. He turns it on and walks around the lobby, holding it at chest level. The device beeps softly, a small electronic heartbeat. He holds it near the kitchen door, the stairwell, the laundry room. The screen flickers. It stays green. The beeping remains calm. The room, for once, feels safe in a way that is measurable.

Mara watches him and thinks about the day she checked into the old hostel, the taped vent, the dead detector. She thinks about how a beeping device could have saved so many headaches, so many curled bodies under blue blankets. She thinks about the absurdity of a world where safety is an optional upgrade, like better Wi-Fi or fresh towels.

The men leave. The receptionist sighs and rubs her forehead. "Sorry," she says to no one. "It's been a day."

Mara wants to say, Me too. Instead she nods and goes upstairs.

---

In her room, she opens the window as far as it will go. The air is damp and cool. The ceiling fan pushes it around in slow circles. The room smells like clean sheets and a hint of bread from the bakery next door. It is a good smell, a safe smell. She sits on the bed and lets her body sink into the mattress. The oxygen had made her feel almost normal, and now that feeling is fading. Her head is back to a low, steady ache, like a drum being played on the other side of a wall.

She takes out her phone and scrolls through her feed out of habit. Her last post is a video from two days ago, a cheerful clip about street markets and cheap eats. The comments are a mix of heart emojis and warnings about altitude. Someone wrote, "Heard about the hostel leak. You ok?" Someone else wrote, "Quito air is a scam lol." She scrolls without reading too closely. She feels like she is watching someone else's life.

She opens her camera app and points it at her face. The lighting is bad. Her eyes look tired. Her lips are still too pink. She thinks about making a post: a safety PSA, a cautionary tale, a humble little story about being careful with heaters and ventilation. She thinks about the comments, the DMs, the worry. She thinks about the other hostel's name, the way it sits in the article like a blame. She thinks about the men in uniforms and the clipboard.

She puts the phone down without recording. She is not ready to turn the room into content. She is not ready to be the face of carbon monoxide. She is not ready to be the cautionary tale.

She lays back and closes her eyes. The ceiling fan hums. The bed holds her like an apology. She drifts for a few minutes and then jerks awake, the way people do when their body doesn't trust its own sleep. Her heart is pounding. She listens to the room. Nothing. Only the fan and the faint sound of music from the common room downstairs. Salsa again, a bright rhythm that feels like it is happening in another world.

She sits up and finds her oxygen can on the nightstand. The can is warm from the room. She presses the nozzle to her mouth and gives herself a short hiss. It is cold and plasticky and completely ridiculous. It makes her feel better anyway. She hates that it does. She hates the dependence, the ritual, the way a gimmick has become her friend.

Hannah knocks on her door. "Hey," she says, sticking her head in. "I have a walking tour in an hour. Are you okay to rest?"

"Yeah," Mara says. She is not sure. She wants Hannah to go. She also wants Hannah to stay. She is tired of needing people. She nods. "Go. I'll nap." She makes a little shooing gesture, like it's nothing.

Hannah hesitates. "Text me if you feel weird. Like, weirder than now." She tries to smile. It doesn't work.

"I will," Mara says. She hears the lie before it leaves her mouth.

After Hannah leaves, the room feels larger and emptier. The air moves. The fan hums. The window is open. She is safe. She is alone.

She tries to sleep again. She drifts, she wakes, she drifts. Her dreams are a collage of blue blankets and flickering flames and the word monóxido printed on cheap plastic boxes. She wakes with the taste in her mouth, sharper now, like she has been sucking on a copper penny. She sits up and spits into the trash can. The spit is normal. That makes it worse.

Her phone buzzes. She expects another blank message. It's her mother, asking if the clinic said anything. Mara types, "They said altitude and stress. Gave oxygen. I'm ok." She adds a smiley face that looks fake. She hits send.

She opens her messages and there is a new one from a number she doesn't recognize. This one doesn't have the blank profile. It has no profile at all. It says, "Statement? Need names." It is from the hostel manager. He must have gotten her number from the check-in form. She stares at the screen. Her pulse quickens.

She types back, "What happened?" The question is honest and useless. The manager replies with a link to the article she already read and a single sentence: "Police might call. Sorry." The apology is small and late and ineffective.

She places the phone face down. She wishes she could put the memory face down too.

She goes to the bathroom and splashes water on her face. The water is cold. The mirror shows a girl with damp hair and pink lips and eyes that look too bright. She looks like she has been crying or laughing. She has done neither. She presses her fingers to her cheeks and feels heat under her skin. She thinks about how carbon monoxide is called the silent killer, how it leaves no marks, how it makes people look healthy until they are not. She has always liked hidden dangers because they make good stories. She does not like them when they live under her skin.

She returns to the room and opens her laptop. She writes a note in her travel spreadsheet: "Leave Quito early?" She puts a question mark, because she is still pretending this is a choice. She checks bus schedules to Baños, a place with hot springs and fresh air, a place that promises healing the way a brochure promises anything. The buses leave at 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. She highlights the 7 a.m. time and then doesn't book it. She tells herself she will in a minute.

She hears a commotion in the hallway. Voices, quick and urgent. She cracks her door and looks out. Two people in uniforms are guiding a young woman down the hall. The woman is pale and walking unsteadily. Her hair is damp, her lips the same too-pink color Mara has been staring at all day. The woman doesn't see Mara. She is looking at the floor, holding the wall with one hand. A man in a uniform carries a small oxygen tank beside her.

"From the old hostel?" someone whispers in Spanish.

"Sí," someone answers.

Mara's hand tightens on the door. She watches them pass, the little hiss of the tank trailing behind like a ghost. The woman looks about Mara's age. The woman looks like she should be in a hostel kitchen, laughing about how cheap the coffee is. Instead she is being guided down a hallway with an oxygen tank like a patient.

Mara shuts the door quietly and leans against it. Her heart is racing. The taste in her mouth thickens. She breathes through her nose, slowly. The air is clean. The taste stays.

She sits on the bed with her laptop open and pretends to work. She writes a draft of a post she doesn't plan to share: "PSA: If your hostel has gas heaters, crack a window. Seriously. Don't let anyone tape over vents. Bring a detector if you can. The air can look fine and still hurt you." She reads it and deletes it. It feels like she is writing it for herself, not the internet. She doesn't want to be her own audience.

She scrolls through her drafts and sees the one from last week, a cheerful list of "Seven Things You Must Do in Quito." She laughs at the title, a small, bitter sound. She adds an eighth, in her head: "Don't die in a hostel." It is the kind of dark joke she used to make in videos, the punchline to a safety segment. It feels less funny now that it is not hypothetical.

Her headache pulses behind her eyes. She takes ibuprofen and drinks water. She lies down again. The fan hums. The window sighs. She tells herself she will nap for twenty minutes. She sets a timer. The timer goes off and she doesn't remember falling asleep. That worries her more than it should.

She wakes to darkness. For a second she doesn't know where she is. The room is a shape. The fan is a whisper. Her phone lights up on the nightstand. It is 7:12 p.m. The sun has gone down. She slept through the late afternoon.

Her head feels thick and slow, like she has been underwater. She sits up. Her stomach turns. The taste is stronger. She presses her tongue to her teeth and tastes metal. She reaches for the oxygen can and realizes it's empty. She shakes it anyway. It gives a hollow rattle. She laughs once, a short, sharp sound that scares her.

She opens the window wider. The air is cold. It makes her shiver. She breathes in and out, counting. One. Two. Three. Four. She loses count. She starts again.

Her phone buzzes with a message from Hannah. "Tour ended. I'm grabbing food. You want soup?" Mara types, "No thanks. Napping." She doesn't mention the empty oxygen can. She doesn't mention the darkness. She doesn't mention that she is afraid of sleeping.

She goes downstairs because she can't stand the room. The common area is full of people eating dinner, talking over bowls of stew. The smell of garlic and cilantro makes her stomach tighten. She sits in a corner with a cup of tea and listens to the chatter. The conversation is the same as always: where are you from, where are you going, how long are you staying. Someone mentions the gas leak at the old hostel and the room goes a little quiet for a moment, then fills again with the rush of people trying to be normal.

"I heard the owner is in trouble," a woman says in English. "They had taped the vents. Like, literally taped them." She laughs as if she can't believe it. The laugh is sharp. "Can you imagine?" She looks around for agreement.

Mara sips her tea and imagines it because she has. She wants to say something. She doesn't. She lets the woman keep talking. She lets the information pass through her like air.

Another person says, "My cousin says carbon monoxide is like being drunk. You just go to sleep." He says it as if it is a comfort. The room hums with murmured horror. Someone jokes about buying a detector from Amazon. Someone else says, "But we are safe here, right?" and everyone looks at the green blinking dot on the wall and nods.

Mara nods too. She tells herself she is safe here. She tells herself it is okay to sleep. She tells herself to stop being dramatic. She is good at that. It is one of her strengths.

She goes back upstairs with a bowl of soup and eats half of it. The rest sits on the desk, steaming. She watches the steam rise and drift toward the fan, the way it bends and swirls in the moving air. She finds herself mesmerized again. Air is invisible until it moves something. It is invisible until it decides not to be.

She opens her laptop and finally books the 7 a.m. bus. The confirmation email arrives with a cheerful subject line: "Your Adventure Awaits!" She almost laughs. She closes the laptop and turns the light off.

She lies in bed with the window open and the fan on. The air is cold on her skin. She can feel it moving over her face, under her eyelids. She should sleep. She does not trust sleep anymore. She keeps one hand on her chest, feeling the rise and fall, counting the beats.

Her phone buzzes once. She looks. A new message from the blank account.

It says: Room nine is empty now.

She stares at the screen until the words blur. She reads them again. The room feels smaller. The fan feels louder. The air feels heavier.

She types, "Who is this?" and deletes it. She types, "Stop." and deletes it. She turns the phone face down and slides it under the pillow like it is a bad dream she can hide.

She closes her eyes. The taste in her mouth is metal. The air moves. The room is quiet. She is alone.

She tells herself she will be gone in the morning. She tells herself that will fix everything. She tells herself that leaving is always the same as safety.

Her heart stutters, a small skip. She holds her breath. She waits. The beat resumes, slow and steady. She releases the breath.

She is almost asleep when she hears a soft beep from the hallway. Just one. Then silence.

Her eyes snap open. The green dot under the door is dark for a second, then blinking again. She lies still, listening for another beep. There is none. She tells herself it's a low battery, a random chirp, a normal thing. She tells herself that as if saying it will make it true.

She closes her eyes and tries to sleep. She dreams of a number on a screen that reads ninety-nine and then ninety-eight and then ninety-seven, ticking down like a clock she can't see.

In the morning, when Hannah knocks, Mara does not answer right away. Hannah knocks again, louder. When Mara finally sits up, her head is heavy, her mouth tastes like pennies, and she can't remember if she slept at all.

She opens the door with a smile that feels pasted on.

"Ready for the bus?" Hannah asks.

Mara nods. She is not sure she is ready for anything.

She grabs her backpack and her passport and follows Hannah down the stairs. The green dot in the hallway blinks at her as she passes, patient and unfeeling. She thinks of the number ninety-nine and how it can still mean you are drowning.
